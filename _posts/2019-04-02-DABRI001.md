### **Statement**

The big Noel is a guy full of habits. This year he put all of his reindeer in
a row and decided to select the most of them, following a few rules.  
\- Reindeer can not be changed in order, ie a reindeer that is in position
i in the original row should appear before the reindeer j in the
chosen list, where i < j.  
\- Reindeer of two adjacent positions in the final sequence must differ
exactly by 1 (right-left=1) unit in their heights.

If that was not enough, Noel realized that this sequence had few reindeer. So
she decided to include a new reindeer in the original row. Taking into account
that this new reindeer can be inserted in any position and he will always
choose a reindeer with the best possible height.

After making the task a little difficult, Noel ended up getting confused and
is asking for your help to find out how many reindeer can be selected taking
into account the rules imposed.

### Input

The first line of the entry contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤
10<sup>5</sup>) corresponding to the number of reindeer. In the second
line contains N integers X<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ X<sub>i</sub>
≤ 10<sup>6</sup>) which represents the height of the i th reindeer.

### Output

Print as many reindeer as Noel can select.

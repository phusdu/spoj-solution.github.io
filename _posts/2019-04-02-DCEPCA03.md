### **Statement**

Given the value of N, you will have to find the value of H. The meaning of H
is given in the following code:

` H=0;  
For (i=1; i<=n; i++) {  
For (j=1; j<=n; j++) {  
H = H + totient(i) * totient(j);  
}  
} `

Totient or phi function, φ(n) is an arithmetic function that counts the
number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime
to n. That is, if n is a positive integer, then φ(n) is the number of integers
k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which gcd(n, k) = 1

### Constraints

0 < T <= 50  
0 < N <= 10^4

### Input

The first line contains T, the number of test cases. It is followed by T lines
each containing a number N .

### Output

For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the
value of H for the corresponding N.

### **Statement**

The director of a new movie needs to create a scaled set for the movie. In the
set there will be N skyscrapers, with distinct integer heights from 1 to N
meters. The skyline will be determined by the sequence of the heights of the
skyscrapers from left to right. It will be a permutation of the integers from
1 to N.

The director is extremely meticulous, so she wants to avoid a certain sloping
pattern. She doesn’t want for there to be ANY three buildings in positions i,
j and k, i < j < k, where the height of building i is smaller than that of
building j, and building j’s height is smaller than building k’s height.

Your task is to tell the director, for a given number of buildings, how many
distinct orderings for the skyline avoid the sloping pattern she doesn't like.

### Input

There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will consist of
a single line containing a single integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 1,000), which represents
the number of skyscrapers. The heights of the skyscrapers are assumed to be 1,
2, 3, ..., N. The input will end with a line with a single 0.

### Output

For each test case, output a single integer, representing the number of good
skylines - those avoid the sloping pattern that the director dislikes - modulo
1,000,000. Print each integer on its own line with no spaces. Do not print any
blank lines between answers.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     3  
    4  
    0  
      
     Output:  
     5  
    14

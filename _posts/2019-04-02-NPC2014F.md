### **Statement**

Andy is a successful farmer. He has a field sized 1 x N tiles, where each tile
can be planted a plant. Andy has 26 kind of plants, which is represented by
the letter 'a' - 'z'.

Each month Andy has to pay tax to the government. The government in his place
is very picky. He wants the tax in the form of a block of tiles. He also
demands that the block must contain at least Xi number of plant type Yi. A
block of tiles is all the tile from range a to b. To minimize the loss, Andy
will pay in the smallest block possible. Help Andy to find the length of the
smallest block to satisfy the government.

### Input

Starts with a number N. The next line is a string of length N containing the
letter 'a' to 'z'. The next line is a number K, and for the next K lines are
the Xi and Yi, number and type of plants that must be fulfilled.

### Output

Minimum length of block to pay the tax. If Andy can't pay the tax, output
"Andy rapopo".

### Sample Input 1

    
    
    5  
    aabac  
    3  
    1 a  
    1 b  
    1 c

### Sample Output 1

    
    
    3

### Sample Input 2

    
    
    5  
    aabac  
    3  
    1 a  
    1 b  
    2 c

### Sample Output 2

    
    
    Andy rapopo

### Constraint

  * 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
  * 1 ≤ K ≤ 26
  * 1 ≤ X ≤ 100000
  * Yi is a character from 'a' to 'z'
  * Each Yi type will not appear more than once

Time limit is very strict, some language might not be able to pass.

### **Statement**

You have a bag filled with N balls.Each Ball has a distinct number from 1 to N
printed on it.All the numbers are distinct. You withdraw two balls from the
bag and take their sum. You need to calculate the probability that the sum is
not greater than the given number K(<=N). The Answer should be displayed in
the form of p/q.(except when the answer is 0 or 1)

### Input

Input consists of various test cases. Each test case consist of two integer
inputs,N and K. (0<=K<=N<=1000000000) The program stops taking input when N
and K equals -1

### Output

Output the result in the form of p/q.(Except when the answer is 0 or 1)

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3 2
    100 5
    10 6
    -1 -1
    
    Output:
    0
    2/2475
    2/15

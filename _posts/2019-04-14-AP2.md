### **Statement**

Arithmatic and geometric Progressions are 2 of the well known progressions in
maths.

Arithmatic progression(AP) is a set in which the difference between 2 numbers
in constant. for e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 .... In this series the difference
between 2 numbers is 2.

The task here is very simple indeed.

You will be given the 3rd term , 3rd last term and the sum of the series. You
need print length of the series & the series.

### Input

First line will contain a number indicating the number of test cases.

Each of the following t lines will have 3 number '3term' ,'3Lastterm' and
'sum'

3term - is the 3rd term in of the series and

3Lastterm - is the 3rd term in of the series and

sum - is the sum of the series.

### Output

For each input of the test case, you need to print 2 lines.

First line should have 1 value - the number of terms in the series.

2nd line of the output should print the series numbers separated by single
space.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    3 8 55
    
    Output:
    10
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

NOTE:

  * In all the test cases, all the series elements are positive integers.
  * The series will have at least 7 elements.
  * number of test cases <=100.
  * All the numbers will fit in 64 bits (long long in C)

### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug is visiting her friends who live on a plum
[tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_\(data_structure\)). As many bugs
like her, she has a friend in each node. She has already planed in which order
she will visit them. She does that in following manner. If she is standing at
a node i in the morning, she will choose shortest path to friend with
number i+1. Afterward, she stays there until next morning. First day she
"magically" apears on node number 1 and as she arrives at node N , she
ends her journey. Your task is to find (for each node), the number of days she
visited it (this means she either begins in it, ends in it or passes through
it).

### Input

The first line contains 1 ≤ N ≤ 4*10<sup>5</sup> , number of nodes on
tree.

Each of next N-1 lines contains two integers 1 ≤ I, J ≤ N , I ≠ J
, the nodes which are connected by an edge.

### Output

Print N lines with and integer indicating number of times
i<sup>th</sup> node was visited.

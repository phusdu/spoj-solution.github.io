### **Statement**

_Mohib_ (![Cool](../../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-
cool.gif)![Wink](../../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-
wink.gif) ), as we all known, is very brilliant in mathematics. His friend
_Bar_ has given him another problem to solve.

Bar gives him a sequence of distinct positive integers, whose average is
(A+1).

If Bar append an integer x to the sequence, then the average of integers in
the sequence will be A.

He asked the Mohib to tell him the largest possible integer in the sequence.

### Input

First line contains T, the number of testcases (T <= 5000).

Next T lines contain an integer x (1 <= x <= 49999) and A (x+1 <= A <= 50000).

### Output

Print the largest possible integer in the sequence.

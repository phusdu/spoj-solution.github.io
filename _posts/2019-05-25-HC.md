### **Statement**

### Happy Coins

A line of coins are given, some belongs to lxh while others belongs to hhb.
Now the two guys are about to play a game. In every round of game, each player
can select any two consecutive coins and change them into one coin, if the two
coins belongs to the same person, the new one will be gained to hhb, or else
it will belongs to lxh. The two guys take turns playing this game, lxh always
play first. The game runs round by round. You can easily make sense that we
will get only one coin at the end of game. Now the question is, suppose the
two players perform optimally in the game, which person does the final coin
belongs to?

number of test cases.

10<sup>5</sup>), the number of coins. Following _N_ lines, each line
contains a name, ` lxh` or `hhb`, the name of whom this coins belongs to.

### Output

to.

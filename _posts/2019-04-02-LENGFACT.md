### **Statement**

Given integer n , print length of n! (which is factorial of n ).

### Input

The first line of the standard input contains one integer t (t  < 10001)
which is the number of test cases.

In each of the next t lines there is number n (0  <= n <= 5*10^9).

### Output

For each test, print the length of n! (which is factorial of n ).

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     3  
    1  
    10  
    100  
      
     Output:  
     1  
    7  
    158

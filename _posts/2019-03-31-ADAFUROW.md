### **Statement**

As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She has multiple
furrows in which she grows vegetables. She also never grows multiple
vegetables of the same kind in the same furrow. Ada sometime palnts a new
vegetable, harveest a vegetable or asks for some aspect which two different
furrows have in common (described in input).

### Input

The first line of input will contain 1 ≤ Q ≤ 3*10<sup>5</sup> , the
number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines will contain ? x y : 0 ≤ x, y ≤
2*10<sup>4</sup> , and ? is one of: \+ - v ^ ! \ with following
meaning:

+: Plants vegetable of kind y to furrow number x (note that there will
never be multiple vegetables of the same kind in the same furrow)

-: Harvests vegetable of kind y from furrow number x (note that there will always be a vegetable of that kind)

v: Finds out how many kinds of vegetables there are in furrows x and
y.

^: Finds out how many kinds of vegetable are in both furrows ( x, y )

!: Find out how many kinds of vegetables are in x and y BUT not in
both of them at once.

\: Find out how many kinds of vegetable are in x but not in y

### Output

For each query of the last four kinds, output the proper answer.

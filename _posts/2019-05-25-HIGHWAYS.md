### **Statement**

A number of cities are connected by a network of highways. Each highway is
bidirectional and connects two cities, with a given travel time. What is the
shortest time to get from a given city to another given city?

### Input

The first line of input contains the number of test cases.  
  
Each test case starts with a line containing the number of cities n (2 ≤ n ≤
100000), the number of highways m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100000), the starting city and the
ending city. Cities are numbered from 1 to n.  
  
Then m lines follow, each describing one highway. The description consists of
the two distinct city numbers and the time in minutes to travel along the
highway. The time will be between 1 and 1000.  

### Output

For each test case output a single line containing the minimum time it takes
to get from the start to the destination. If no connection exists, output
`NONE`.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    4 2 1 4
    1 2 5
    3 4 5
    4 4 1 4
    1 2 5
    2 3 5
    3 4 5
    4 2 6
    
    Output:
    NONE
    11

### **Statement**

Documento sin t√≠tulo

Maja is a bee. She lives in a bee hive with thousands of other bees. This bee
hive consists of many hexagonal honey combs where the honey is stored in.  
But bee Maja has a problem. Willi told her where she can meet him, but because
Willi is a male drone and Maja is a female worker they have different
coordinate systems.  

Maja's Coordinate System  |  Willi's Coordinate System  
---|---  
  
Maja who often flies directly to a special honey comb has laid an advanced two
dimensional grid over the whole hive.

|

Willi who is more lazy and often walks around just numbered the cells
clockwise starting from 1 in the middle of the hive.

![Willi](/content/boodah:willi.jpg)  
  
Help Maja to convert Willi's system to hers. Write a program which for a given
honey comb number gives the coordinates in Maja's system.

Input

The input contains one or more integers which represent Willi's numbers. Each
number stands on its own in a separate line, directly followed by a newline.
The honey comb numbers are all less than 100 000.

Output

You should output the corresponding Maja coordinates to Willi's numbers, each
coordinate pair on a separate line.

Sample Input

1  
2  
3  
4  
5

  
Sample Output

0 0  
0 1  
-1 1   
-1 0   
0 -1

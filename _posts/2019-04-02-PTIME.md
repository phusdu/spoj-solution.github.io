### **Statement**

For your math homework this week your teacher gave you five large numbers and
asked you to find their prime factors. However these numbers aren't _nearly_
large enough for someone with knowledge of programming like yourself. So you
decide to take the factorial of each of these numbers. Recall that N! (N
factorial) is the product of the integers from 1 through N (inclusive). It’s
your job now to create a program to help you do your homework.

###  Input

Each test case contains a number N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10000).

### Output

The output should contain a line representing the prime factorization of the
factorial given number, which should be of the form:
_p<sub>1</sub>^e<sub>1</sub> * p<sub>2</sub>^e<sub>2</sub> *
... * p<sub>k</sub>^e<sub>k</sub>_ where p<sub>1</sub>,
p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>k</sub> are the distinct prime factors of
the factorial of the given number in increasing order, and e<sub>1</sub>,
e<sub>2</sub>, ..., e<sub>k</sub> are their exponents.

###  Example

    
    
    Input:
    10
    
    Output:
    2^8 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7^1

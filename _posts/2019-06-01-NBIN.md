### **Statement**

One day Chandrima decided to make a list of all numbers in binary format, the
list would be like 0,1,10,11,100,... and so on.

Now she get bored of this list and decide to remove any pattern having atleast
two consecutive ones and prepare a new list.

The new list will be like 0,1,10,100,101,... and so on. She then thought if a
number n is given to her can she find the nth

member of the new list. After trying for some time she comes to you for help.
Can you help her by writing a program for her that

coud do the specified task

One day Chandrima decided to make a list of all numbers starting from 1 in
binary format, the list would be like 1,10,11,100,... and so on. Now she get
bored of this list and decide to remove any pattern having atleast two
consecutive ones and prepare a new list. The new list will be like
1,10,100,101,... and so on. She then thought if a number n is given to her can
she find the n<sup>th</sup> member of the new list. After trying for some
time she comes to you for help. Can you help her by writing a program for her
that coud do the specified task

### Input

The first line contains T(<=1000) test cases. The next T lines each contain
one integer N(<=10^15) for which you need to find the Nth member of the list.

### Output

Output T lines each containing the required answer.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    
    
    1
    
    
    2
    
    
    3
    
    Output:
    1

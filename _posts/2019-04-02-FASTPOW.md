### **Statement**

You are asked to compute A^B (A to the power of B) (1 <= A,B <= 100 000 000).
You surely understand that this number can be quite astonishing and i don't
like big numbers unless they are on my paycheck so I'm just interested in the
reminder of A^B mod C (1<= C <= 1000000)

### Input

Three integers A B and C.

### Output

Single integer - the result of the computation.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2 10 1000
    
    Output:
    24

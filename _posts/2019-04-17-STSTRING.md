### **Statement**

Given two strings A and B, we define the operator ĉ on {A,B} for string C as C
ĉ {A,B}.

    
    
    if length(A) < length(C) < length(B), then C satisfies the above operator.
    else
          if length(A)=length(C), then C must be lexicographically greater than A.
          if length(B)=length(C), then C must be lexicographically smaller than B.
    

### Input

Given two strings A,B with length(A) < = length(B) <= 6. A,B can contain any
characters between A and J (capital letters).

### Output

Print the number of strings satisfying the above criteria. C must also satisfy
criteria of A and B. Any two adjacent characters in string C may neither be
the same nor consecutve (i.e. the absoulte difference between the ASCII values
of adjacent characters is greater than 1).

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    A J
    AA BCD
    ABC DEFG
    
    Output:
    8
    129
    1770

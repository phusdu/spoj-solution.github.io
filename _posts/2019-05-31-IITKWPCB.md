### **Statement**

Find largest non-negative number less than or equal to floor (N/2) which is
coprime to N.

Two number a and b are considered to coprime if gcd (a, b) = 1.

### Input

T : numbr of test cases (T <= 1000)

For next T lines, every line contains n >= 1 && n <= 10^12;

### Output

For each test case, output as described in the problem statement.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4  
     3  
    4

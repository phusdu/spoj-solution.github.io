### **Statement**

One rich person decided to make himself a great garden. The garden should have
a from of equilateral triangle. There should be a gazebo inside the garden.
The gazebo will be connected with the triangle vertexes by roads. The lengths
of all three roads are known. Those numbers are sacred for this rich man. The
expense of building such a garden will depend on the area of the garden. Help
the rich man by calculating what will be the area of his garden.

### Input

The first line of the input contains number t â€“ the amount of tests. Then
t test descriptions follow. Each test consist of three integers a ,
b , c \- the lengths of the roads. It is guaranteed that it's possible
to build such a garden.

### Constraints

1 <= t <= 1000  
1 <= a , b , c <= 1000

### Output

For each test print the area of the garden rounded to two decimal places.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    3 4 5
    
    Output:

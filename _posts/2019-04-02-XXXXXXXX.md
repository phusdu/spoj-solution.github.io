### **Statement**

You are given N numbers. You have to perform two kinds of operations:  
U x y - x-th number becomes equal to y.  
Q x y - calculate the sum of distinct numbers from x-th to y-th. It means that
the sum for the set {1, 2, 3, 2, 7} will be equal to 13 (1+2+3+7).

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer N. 1<=N<=50000  
The second line consists of N numbers.  
The third line consists of an integer Q. 1<=Q<=100000  
The following Q lines will consist of queries of the form described in the
task description.  
All numbers in input will fit in the signed 32-bit type.

### Output

Output an answer for every query of the second type.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     5  
    1 2 4 2 3                                                                                
    3  
    Q 2 4  
    U 4 7  
    Q 2 4  
      
     Output:  
     6  
    13  
      
    

Hint: Time limit is ~ 1.5*(my program's execution time in the worst case)

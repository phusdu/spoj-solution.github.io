### **Statement**

In this problem you will be given a half-circle. The half-circle’s radius is
_r_. You can take any point A on the half-circle and draw 2 lines from the
point to the two sides of the diameter(AB and AC). Let the sum of square of
one line’s length and the other line’s length is _s_

Like in the figure _s_ = _AB_ <sup>2</sup> + _AC_. And _BC_ = 2 _r_.

Now given _r_ you have to find the maximum value of _s_. That is you have to
find point A such that _AB_ <sup>2</sup> + _AC_ is maximum.

### Input

First line of the test case will be the number of test case T (1  <= T <=
1000). Then T lines follows. On each line you will find a integer number _r_
(1  <= _r_ <= 1000000); each representing the radius of the half-circle.

### Output

For each input line, print a line containing `"Case I: "`, where I is the test
case number and the maximum value of _s_. Print 2 digit after decimal (Errors
should be less then .01).

### Example

    
    
    Sample Input:
    1
    1
    
    Sample Output:
    Case 1: 4.25

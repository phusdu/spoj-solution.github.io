### **Statement**

You are given an unweighted, undirected tree. Write a program to find a vertex
set of minimum size in this tree such that each edge has as least one of its
end-points in that set.

### Input

The first line of the input file contains one integer _N_ \--- number of nodes
in the tree (0  < _N_ <= 100000). Next _N_ -1 lines contain _N_ -1 edges of
that tree --- Each line contains a pair ( _u_ , _v_ ) means there is an edge
between node _u_ and node _v_ (1  <= _u_ , _v_ <= _N_ ).

### Output

Print number of nodes in the satisfied vertex set on one line.

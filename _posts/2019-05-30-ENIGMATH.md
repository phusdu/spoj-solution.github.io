### **Statement**

You would have been fed up with competitive programming questions so far, now
it is time to solve little math.

Assume you have a equation A * x - B * y = 0

For a given value of A and B , find the minimum positive integer value
of x and y that satisfies this equation.

### Input

First line contains T , number of test cases 0 <= T <=1000 followed by
T lines.

First line of each test case contains two space seperated integers A and
B. 1  <= A , B <=1 000 000 000.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line containing two integers x and
y (seperated by a single space).

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    2 3
    
    Output:
    3 2

Note:

  * Brute force won't pass the given constraint.
  * Negative number cases are avoided to make the problem easy.

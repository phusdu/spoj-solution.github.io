### **Statement**

Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as _b<sup>n</sup>_ ,
involving two numbers, the base _b_ and the exponent _n_. When _n_ is a
positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the
base: that is, _b<sup>n</sup>_ is the product of multiplying _n_ bases:

_b<sup>n</sup>_ = b x b x b x .......... x b

In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one
number by another (sometimes called _modulus_ ). Given two positive numbers,
_a_ (the dividend) and _n_ (the divisor), _a_ modulo _n_ (abbreviated as _a_
mod _n_ ) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of _a_ by _n_. For
instance, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2
leaves a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1, while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to
0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of
0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3.

Now, you are given the value of a,b and m. print the value of
a<sup>b</sup> mod m

### Input

First line contains the number of test cases t (1  <= t <=
10<sup>4</sup>). Next t line contains three integers a, b and m. where 1
<= a, b <= 10<sup>9 </sup>and 1 <= m <= 2<sup>64</sup>

### Output

For each test case print the answer of the problem.

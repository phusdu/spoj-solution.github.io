### **Statement**

As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She has a long alley
of trees. She wants the alley to look good so she has decided to make the
heights of all trees equal. She has two possible operations: she can either
cut the top of a tree, decreasing its height by one (at cost of 1 ) or
cut the tree down (at cost of height<sub>i</sub> ).

### Input

The first line of input will contain 1 ≤ N ≤ 3*10<sup>5</sup> , the
number of trees.

The next line will contain N integers 0 ≤ H<sub>i</sub> ≤
10<sup>9</sup>

### Output

Print the minimal cost to make the height of all trees in alley equal.

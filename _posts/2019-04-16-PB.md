### **Statement**

![Illustration](/content/simba:p6.jpg) Luke Skywalker successfully leads the
rebel starship fleet to break the Emperor's siege of the planet Endor. The
rebels, jubilant in their victory, return to their base on the moon of Endor
to pay their homage to Princess Leia. They fly towards the parking bay where
there are n parking slots in a row. One by one n starships numbered
S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>n</sub> enter the parking bay. Each rebel
R<sub>i</sub> heads to his favorite parking slot P<sub>i</sub>, and if
it is free, he docks his starship there. Otherwise, he continues further to
the next free slot and occupies it. But if all succeeding slots are occupied,
he leaves for good. How many sequences P<sub>i</sub> are such that every
rebel can dock his starship?

### Input Description

The first line of the input is a positive integer t ≤ 20, which is the number
of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow one after the other.
The description of each test case contains exactly one line (a positive
integer), containing the value of n ≤ 1000000.

### Output Description

The output consists of exactly t lines. The ith line should be
A<sub>i</sub>%10007, where A<sub>i</sub> is the number of sequences in
the i<sup>th</sup> case, and 'x%y' represents the remainder when x is
divided by y.

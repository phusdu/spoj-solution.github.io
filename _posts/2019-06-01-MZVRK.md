title:  MZVRK - Whirligig number

### **Statement**

[English](/problems/MZVRK/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/MZVRK/vn/)  
---|---  
  
By removing all digits left of the rightmost digit one in the binary
representation of some integer, we get what is called the "whirligig" of that
number. For example, the whirligig of 6 i.e. (110)2 is 2 i.e. (10)2, and the
whirligigof 40 i.e. (101000)2 is 8 i.e. (1000)2. Write a program that will
calculate the sum of the whirligig of all numbers between two given numbers A
and B (inclusive).

### Input

First and only line of input contains two integers A and B, 1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 10^15.

### Output

First and only line of output should contain the sum from the problem
statement.

Note: the result will fit into the 64-bit signed integer type.

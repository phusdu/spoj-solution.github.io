### **Statement**

Problem statement:

You are given two DNA sequences A and B. It is said that these two DNA
sequences are related if there exists a non-decreasing sequence C of the same
length, such that C<sub>i </sub> = A<sub>i</sub> or
C<sub>i</sub> = B<sub>i</sub>. Find if the given sequences are
related.

Input format:

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.

For each test case:  
The first line contains an integer,N, the length of the DNA sequence.  
The second line contains a sequence of space-separated integers describing
species A.  
The third line contains a sequence of space-separated integers describing
species B.

Output Format

On a new line for each test case, print YES if a non-decreasing sequence
of the same length can be found or NO if it cannot.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 5  
1 <= N <= 10 ^ 5  
0 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 10 ^ 10

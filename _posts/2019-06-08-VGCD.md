### **Statement**

Given two integers a and b find their greatest common divisor.

### Input

The first line of the input file contains number 0 < n < 1000 the amount of
tests. The description of n test cases follow. The description of a test case
consists of two lines. The first line contains integer a (0 < a < 10^12540),
the second â€“ integer b (0 < b < 10^12540). It is also known that all the
numbers in the input file are the determinants of the square matrix of the
form:

### Output

For each test case print the greatest common divisor of integers a and b on a
separate line.

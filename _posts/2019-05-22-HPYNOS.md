### **Statement**

The process of “ breaking ” an integer is defined as summing the squares
of its digits. For example, the result of breaking the integer 125 is (
1<sup>2</sup> \+ 2<sup>2</sup> \+ 5<sup>2</sup> ) =
30. An integer N is happy if after “ breaking ” it repeatedly
the result reaches 1. If the result never reaches 1 no matter how many times
the “ breaking ” is repeated, then N is not a happy number.

TASK

Write a program that given an integer N, determines whether it is a happy
number or not.

CONSTRAINTS

2 ≤ N ≤ 2,147,483,647

### Input

A single line containing a single integer N.

### Output

A single line containing a single integer T which is the number of times
the process had to be done to determine that N is happy, or -1 if N is
not happy.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    19
    
    Output:
    4
    
    
    1) 19  : 1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82
    2) 82  : 82 + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68
    3) 68  : 6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100
    4) 100 : 1<sup>2 </sup>+ 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1

The solution is 4 because we discovered that the integer 19 is happy after we
repeated the process 4 times.

    
    
    Input:
    204
    
    Output:
    -1
    
    
    204 –> 20 – > 4 –> 16 –> 37 –> 58 –> 89 –> 145 –> 42 –> 20 – > 4 –> 16 –> 37 –> 58 –> 89 –> 145 ……

204 is not a happy number because after breaking it several times the
results start repeating so we can deduce that if we continue breaking it, the
result will never reach 1.

Number of input files is 32.

Don't use pre-calculated values (Don't Cheat)!!!

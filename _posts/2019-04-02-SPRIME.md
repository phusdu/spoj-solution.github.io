### **Statement**

In mathematics, a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number which has
exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself.

Super-prime numbers are the elements of the subsequence of prime-numbers that
occupy prime-numbered positions within the sequence of all prime numbers. That
is, if p(i) denotes the ith prime number, the numbers in this sequence are
those of the form p(p(i)) or Primes with a prime index in the sequence of
prime numbers (the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, ... prime).

Your task is to generate all super primes < 10^7.

### **Statement**

You are given a rooted tree with N nodes, numbered from 1 to N. Initially node
1 is the root. Each node i has a weight W[i]. You have to perform two types of
operations:  
"S a" \- Find the sum of weights of node a 's sub-tree nodes
(including node a ).  
"R a" \- Change root of the tree to a.

### Input

Line 1: N (1  <= N <= 10<sup>5</sup>), number of nodes.  
Line 2: N space-separated integers, weights of nodes from 1 to N. i
'th integer is W[i] (1 <= W[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>).  
Line 3: N-1 space-separated integers, i 'th integer is the parent of
node i+1.  
Line 4: Q, the number of operations (1  <= Q <= 10<sup>5</sup>).  
Lines 5 .. 5+Q-1: Every line contains a space separated character and an
integer. Character describes the type of the operation, and integer is the
node number.

### Output

For each operation of type 'S', output the operations result in a separate
line.

### Example

    
    
    _Input:_
    5
    2 1 1 1 2
    1 1 2 2

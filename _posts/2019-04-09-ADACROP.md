### **Statement**

As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She has a very long
furrow with many kinds of vegetables (represented by integer numbers).
Whenever she wants to harvest a single vegetable, she always replace it with
anoher vegetable (possibly same kind).

After each replacement, she wants to know the number of vegetables of the same
kind (at the new vegetable) which are before it (have lower possition in
furrow).

### Input

The first line of input containts 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 2*10<sup>5</sup> , the
length of furrow and number of harvests.

The next line contains N numbers 0 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤
10<sup>9</sup> the kind of vegetable which is currently on
i<sup>th</sup> spot in furrow (indexed from 0).

The next Q lines contains two numbers 0 ≤ i < N (the index of
harvested plant) and 0 ≤ a ≤ 10<sup>9</sup> (the kind of newly planted
vegetable)

### Output

For each harvest, print the number of vegetables of the same kind before the
newly planted vegetable.

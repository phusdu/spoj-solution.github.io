### **Statement**

How many permutations of the first N numbers exist such that the maximum
element between the indices [i..j] is either present at index i, or at index j
?

  
Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines
contains an integer N

  
Output

Output T lines containing the required answer for the corresponding test case.
Since the answers can get really big, output the result modulo 1000000007.

Example

    
    
    Sample Input:
    1
    2
    
    Sample Output:
    2

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10000

1 <= N <= 1000000000



#### **Solution**

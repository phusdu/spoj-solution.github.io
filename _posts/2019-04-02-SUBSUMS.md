### **Statement**

Given a sequence of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 34) numbers S<sub>1</sub>, ...,
S<sub>N</sub> (-20,000,000 ≤ S<sub>i</sub> ≤ 20,000,000), determine
how many subsets of S (including the empty one) have a sum between A and B
(-500,000,000 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 500,000,000), inclusive.

### Input

The first line of standard input contains the three integers N, A, and B. The
following N lines contain S<sub>1</sub> through S<sub>N</sub>, in
order.

### Output

Print a single integer to standard output representing the number of subsets
satisfying the above property. Note that the answer may overflow a 32-bit
integer.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3 -1 2
    1
    -2
    3
    
    Output:
    5
    

The following 5 subsets have a sum between -1 and 2:

  * 0 = 0 (the empty subset)
  * 1 = 1
  * 1 + (-2) = -1
  * -2 + 3 = 1
  * 1 + (-2) + 3 = 2

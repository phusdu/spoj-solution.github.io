### **Statement**

A country has n islands numbered 0 to n-1. Some of these islands are connected
by bridges. You are given that all bridges are two-way. Moreover, the initial
network is such that it is possible to go from any island to any other island
(via bridges). However, the country could face trouble when the water level
rises and islands are submerged. When an island is submerged, all bridges
incident on that island are shutdown. We call an island z _bad_ if submerging
that bridge disconnects the country, i.e., there exist two islands x, y such
that we cannot go from x to y if z is submerged (x, y are distinct from z).
You are required to find all the bad islands in the city.

### Input

First line of input consists of 2 space separated integers n and m. n denotes
the number of islands and m denotes the total number of bridges initially. m
lines follow.

Each of the m lines denotes the two endpoints of a bi-directional bridge.

### Output

Output a list of the bad islands in sorted order.

### **Statement**

Two players play the following game:  
a) A number N is chosen  
b) players move alternately starting from player1  
c) On his turn, a player may subtract either 1, 2 , 3 .. or M ( M <= N ) from
N.  
d) The player to make N equal to 0, wins.  
e) Both play optimally. That is, if there is a move which makes a player win,
he is sure to find it.  
Given the starting value N, determine who wins the game.  
  
Input:  
First line consists of the number of test cases T (T <= 1000). Each of the
next T lines consists of two integers, the numbers N and M (1 <= N <= 2000).  
  
Output:  
You must ouput T lines. Output "player 1 wins" (without quotes) if the first
player wins, else output "player 2 wins"  
  
Example:  
input:  
2  
4 4  
2 1  
  
  
output:  
player1 wins  
player2 wins

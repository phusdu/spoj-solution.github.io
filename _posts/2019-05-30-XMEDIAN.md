### **Statement**

Given an array x of n elements find the medians of its first k elements for
each k from 1 to n inclusive. The median of an array is the middle element of
that array when it is sorted. If there are an even number of elements in the
array, we choose the first of the middle two elements to be the median.

### Input

The first line of input contains number n (1 <= n <= 200000) - the amount of
elements in the array. The next n lines contain the elements xi (1 <= xi <=
1000000).

### Output

Output n integers - the medians of the first k elements of the array for each
k from 1 to n inclusive.

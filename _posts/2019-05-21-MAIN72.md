### **Statement**

You are given an array of N integers. Now you want to find the sum of all
those integers which can be expressed as the sum of at least one subset of the
given array.

### Input

First line contains T the number of test case. then T test cases follow, first
line of each test case contains N (1 <= N <= 100) the number of integers, next
line contains N integers, each of them is between 0 and 1000 (inclusive).

### Output

For each test case print the answer in a new line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    2
    0 1
    3
    2 3 2
    
    Output:
    1

### **Statement**

We call an integer _Sticks_ if its decimal representation contains only digit
1.

Let S( n ) be the sticks with n digits, find the sum of digits of
S(n)<sup>2</sup>

For example, S(9)<sup>2</sup>=12345678987654321, its sum of digits is 81.

### Input

Each line contains an integer represents n (1 ≤ n ≤
10<sup>18</sup>).

Input is terminated by EOF, and contains at most 100 lines.

### Output

For each n , print an integer represents the answer.

### Example

### **Statement**

The problem is very _simple_.

You are given a even number N and an integer K and you have to
find the greatest odd number M less than N such that the sum of digits
in binary representation of M is atmost K.

### Input

For each testcase, you are given an even number N and an integer K.

### Output

For each test case, output the integer M if it exists, else print -1.

### Constraints

1 <= T <= 10^4

2 <= N <= 10^9

0 <= K <= 30

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    10 2
    6 1
    
    Output:
    9
    1

### Explanation

First case when _N_ = 10, _K_ = 2

Binary representaion of 10 is _1010_ and binary representation of 9 is
_1001_ , hence greatest odd number less than 10 whose sum of digits in its
binary representation is atmost 2 is 9. Hence _output_ is 9

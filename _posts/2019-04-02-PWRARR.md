### **Statement**

You are given an array of N integers. The power of this array is the sum of
power of every element of the array. The power of any element is the total
number of element (including it) in the array that are not greater than this
element. For example:

If the array contains 3 elements and they are 1, 2, 3 then the power of this
array is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

### Input

First line contains test cases t (1 <= t <= 100). Each of the test case
contains two lines. First line contains the value of N (1 <= N <= 50000) and
second line contains N space separated positive integers less than or equal to
50000.

### Output

For each test case print the power of the array.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    2
    1 2
    3
    1 2 3
    
    Output:
    3
    6

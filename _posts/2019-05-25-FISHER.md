### **Statement**

![A Fishmonger](/content/ahven:fisher.jpg)A fishmonger wants to bring his
goods from the port to the market. On his route he has to traverse an area
with many tiny city states. Of course he has to pay a toll at each border.

Because he is a good business man, he wants to choose the route in such a way
that he has to pay as little money for tolls as possible. On the other hand,
he has to be at the market within a certain time, otherwise his fish start to
smell.

### Input

The first line contains the number of states _n_ and available time _t_. The
first state is the port, the last state is the market. After this line there
are _n_ lines with _n_ numbers each, specifying for each state the travel time
to the _i_ -th state. This table is terminated with an empty line. The table
of the tolls follows in the same format.

_n_ is at least 3 and at most 50. The time available is less than 1000. All
numbers are integers.

There are many test cases separated by an empty line. Input terminates with
number of states and time equal 0 0.

### Output

For each test case your program should print on one line the total amount of
tolls followed by the actual travelling time.

### Example

    
    
    Sample input:
    4 7
    0 5 2 3
    5 0 2 3
    3 1 0 2
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 2 2 7
    2 0 1 2
    2 2 0 5
    7 2 5 0
    
    0 0
    
    Sample output:
    6 6
    

This corresponds to the following situation, the connections are labeled with
(time, toll):

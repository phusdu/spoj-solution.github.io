### **Statement**

Peter has an amoeba farm with pretty much unlimited amoebae. After years of
research, Peter created a device to convert some amoebae to super amoebae.
However, his device can only be used once. Every day, a super amoeba will
split into M super amoebae (2 < M < 100000).

Now, Peter plan his amoeba selling business. Initially, Peter converts X
amoebae to super amoebae (X > 1). Every day after the amoebae split, Peter
will take Y super amoebae for sale (Y > 1). After N days, Peter want all of
his amoebae to be completely sold out (1 < N < 100000). Since the energy
needed to convert amoebae is quite massive, X must be as small as possible.
Help peter plan his business!

### Input

First line is T, number of test cases (T < 100000). Next T lines each contains
M and N separated by space.

### Output

For each case, output X and Y separated by space. Since X and Y can be very
large, output them with modulo 1000000007.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1  
     4 3
    
    Output:
    21 64

### Explanation

Initially, Peter has 21 super amoebae.  
After day 1, there are 4 x 21 - 64 = 20 super amoebae  
After day 2, there are 4 x 20 - 64 = 16 super amoebae  
After day 3, there are 4 x 16 - 64 = 0 super amoeba  
All the super amoebae are sold out after the 3rd day just as planned.

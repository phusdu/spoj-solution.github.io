Find the longest common substring between the two informed Strings. The
substring can be any part of the String, including the entire String. If there
is no common substring, return 0. The search is _case sensitive_ ('x' != 'X').

### Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed by two lines
that contains a string each. Both input Strings will contain between 1 and 50,
inclusive, letters (a-z, A-Z), and/or spaces.

### Output

The length of the longest common substring between the two Strings.

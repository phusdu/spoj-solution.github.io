### **Statement**

[English](/problems/MINMOVE/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/MINMOVE/vn/)  
---|---  
  
Given a string S[1..n] . A rotation on S is that we move the first character
to the right-most of the string. More specific, after a rotation, S becomes T
= S[2..n] + S[1].

For example: S = abcaa, then after a rotation we have S = bcaaa.

Find the minimum number of rotations to make S become the smallest
lexicographical order string.

### Input

A single line contains a string S. S contains only small letters of English
alphabet (‘a’ .. ‘z’), and the length of S is not more than 100000.

### Output

A single line contains an integer which represents the minimum number of
rotations.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    mississippi
    
    Output:
    10

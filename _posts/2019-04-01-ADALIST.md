categories: ['tree', 'datastructures']
code: ADALIST

### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug has a TODO-list (containing only numbers - for simplicity).
She is still doing something, so she sometimes erases k <sup>th</sup>
number, sometimes she inserts something on k <sup>th</sup> position
and sometime she asks for k <sup>th</sup> number.

Sadly, she is now searching for a work at position k so she doesn't have
time to do this herself. Can you help her?

### Input

The first line will contain 0 < N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>,0 < Q <
5*10<sup>5</sup>, the number of elements in TODO-list and number of
queries.

Then a line with N numbers follows. Each number 0 ≤ A<sub>k</sub> ≤
10<sup>9</sup> means k <sup>th</sup> number in her TODO-list.

Afterward, Q lines follow, each beginning with number 1 ≤ a ≤ 3

1 k x means that you will add number x to position k

2 k means that you will erase number from position k

3 k means that you will print number from position k

For all queries, it is true that 1 ≤ k ≤ #SizeOfList , 0 ≤ x ≤
10<sup>9</sup> (for query 1 , it can be also put to position
#SizeOfList + 1 )

You will never get query of type 2 or 3 if the list is empty

### Output

For each query of type 3 , print k <sup>th</sup> numbers

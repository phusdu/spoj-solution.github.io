### **Statement**

Hanadi has N flower pots each with a unique flower. The pots are arranged
along in a line.

One day, She decided to change their order under the condition that no two
pots that were

originally next to each other remain next to each other.

### Task

write a program that is given the number of pots, calculates the number of
possible orders

satisfying the condition modulo a given integer M.

### Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 2,000 The number of pots.

2 ≤ M ≤ 1,000,000,000

  


### Input

  * Line 1 contains the integer N , the number of flower pots.
  * Line 2 contains the integer M.

### Output

A single line containing one integer between 0 and M-1 (inclusive):
the number of possible

orders modulo M.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     5
    
    
    11
    
    
    Output:  
     3
    
    
    For 5 pots, there are 14 orders satisfying Hanadi's condition, assuming the original order
    
    
    of pots was " ABCDE "
    
    
    Then the 14 possible orders are:
    
    
    ACEBD
    
     ADBEC
    
     BDACE
    
     BDAEC
    
     BECAD
    
     CADBE
    
     CAEBD
    
     CEADB
    
     CEBDA
    
     DACEB
    
     DBEAC
    
     DBECA
    
     EBDAC
    
     ECADB
    
       
    
    
     14 modulo 11 = 3
    
     So the answer is 3. 
    
      
    

  * Number of test-cases is 28.

### **Statement**

Changu and Mangu are brothers. Changu likes 2 and Mangu likes 3. They decided
to express each number as sum of 2 and 3.

They need your help. They want you to tell them the number of ways of writing
a number as ordered sums of 2 and/or 3.

For example,  there are 4 ways to write 8 as an ordered sum of 2s and/or 3s:

2 + 2 + 2 + 2

2 + 3 + 3

3 + 2 + 3

3 + 3 + 2

### Input

The first line contains T, the number of test cases. It is followed by T
lines, each containg a number N.

### Output

You have to print the number of ways of writing N as ordered sum of 2 and/or
3. You have to print the answer mod 1000000007.

### Example

Input:

3

2

8

Output:

### **Statement**

You are given a list of cities. Each direct connection between two cities has
its transportation cost (an integer bigger than 0). The goal is to find the
paths of minimum cost between pairs of cities. Assume that the cost of each
path (which is the sum of costs of all direct connections belongning to this
path) is at most 200000. The name of a city is a string containing characters
a,...,z and is at most 10 characters long.

### Input

    
    
    _s_ [the number of tests  <= 10]
    _n_ [the number of cities  <= 10000]
    _NAME_ [city name]
    _p_ [the number of neighbours of city _NAME_ ]
    _nr_ _cost_ [ _nr_ - index of a city connected to _NAME_ (the index of the first city is 1)]
               [ _cost_ - the transportation cost]
    _r_ [the number of paths to find  <= 100 ]
    _NAME1 NAME2_ [ _NAME1_ - source, _NAME2_ - destination]
    [empty line separating the tests]
    

### Output

    
    
    _cost_ [the minimum transportation cost from city _NAME1_ to city _NAME2_ (one per line)]

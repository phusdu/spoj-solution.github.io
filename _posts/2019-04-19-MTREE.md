### **Statement**

[English](/problems/MTREE/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/MTREE/vn/)  
---|---  
  
As you are bound to know by now, a tree is a connected graph consisting of N
vertices and N−1 edges. Trees also have the property of there being exactly a
single unique path between any pair of vertices. You will be given a tree in
which every edge is assigned a weight – a non negative integer. The weight of
a path is the product of the weights of all edges on the path. The weight of
the tree is the sum of the weights of all paths in the tree. Paths going in
opposite directions (A to B and B to A) are considered the same and, when
calculating the weight of a tree, are counted only once.

Write a program that, given a tree, calculates its weight modulo 1000000007.

### Input

The first line contains the integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100 000), the number of
vertices in the tree. The vertices are numbered 1 to N. Each of the following
N−1 contains three integers A, B and W (1 ≤ A, B ≤ N, 0 ≤ W ≤ 1000) describing
one edge. The edge connects vertices A and B, and its weight is W.

### Output

Output the weight of the tree, modulo 1000000007.

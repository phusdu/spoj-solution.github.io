### **Statement**

Consider the famous euclid algoithm to calculate the GCD of two integers (a,
b):

    
    
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = a;
            a = b;
            b = temp % b;
        }
        return a;
    }

for input (7, 3) the 'while' loop will run 2 times as follows: (7, 3) => (3,
1) => (1, 0)

Now given an integer N you have to find the smallest possible sum of two non-
negative integers a, b (a >= b) such that the while loop in the above
mentioned function for (a, b) will run exactly N times.

### Input

First line of input contains T (1 <= T <= 50) the number of test cases. Each
of the following T lines contains an integer N (0 <= N <= 10^18).

### Output

For each test case print the required answer modulo 1000000007 in a seperate
line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    1
    
    Output:
    2

Explaination: (1,1) is the required pair.

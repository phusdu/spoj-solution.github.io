### **Statement**

Mr. Fenwick has an array a with many integers, and his children love to do
operations on the  
array with their father. The operations can be a query or an update.

  
For each query the children say two indices l and r , and their father
answers back with the sum  
of the elements from indices l to r (both included).

  
When there is an update, the children say an index i and a value x ,
and Fenwick will add x to  
a<sub>i </sub>(so the new value of a<sub>i </sub> is a<sub>i</sub>
+ x ).

  
Because indexing the array from zero is too obscure for children, all indices
start from 1.  
Fenwick is now too busy to play games, so he needs your help with a program
that plays with his  
children for him, and he gave you an input/output specification.  
  

### Input

The first line of the input contains N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> ) . The
second line contains N integers  
a<sub>i</sub> (− 10<sup>9</sup> ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤
10<sup>9</sup> ) , the initial values of the array. The third line
contains Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> ) ,  
the number of operations that will be made. Each of the next Q lines contains
an operation.  
Query operations are of the form “q l r ” ( 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N ) , while update
operations are of the form  
“u i x ” ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N , − 10<sup>9</sup> ≤ x ≤ 10<sup>9</sup> ) .

### Output

You have to print the answer for every query in a different  
line, in the same order of the input.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    10  
     3 2 4 0 42 33 -1 -2 4 4  
    6  
    q 3 5  
    q 1 10  
    u 5 -2  
    q 3 5  
    u 6 7  
    q 4 7
    
    Output:
    46  
     89  
    44  
    79

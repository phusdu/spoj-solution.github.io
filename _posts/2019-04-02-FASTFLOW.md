### **Statement**

Given a graph with N (2 ≤ N ≤ 5,000) vertices numbered 1 to N and M (1 ≤ M ≤
30,000) undirected, weighted edges, compute the [maximum flow / minimum
cut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem) from vertex 1 to
vertex N.

### Input

The first line contains the two integers N and M. The next M lines each
contain three integers A, B, and C, denoting that there is an edge of capacity
C (1 ≤ C ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>) between nodes A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ N). Note that
it is possible for there to be duplicate edges, as well as an edge from a node
to itself.

### Output

Print a single integer (which may not fit into a 32-bit integer) denoting the
maximum flow / minimum cut between 1 and N.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4 6
    1 2 3
    2 3 4
    3 1 2
    2 2 5
    3 4 3
    4 3 3
    
    Output:
    5
    

Viewing the problem as max-flow, we may send 3 units of flow through the path
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 and 2 units of flow through the path 1 - 3 - 4. Viewing the
problem as min-cut, we may cut the first and third edges. Either way the total
is 5.

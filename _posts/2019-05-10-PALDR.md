### **Statement**

[Vietnamese](/problems/PALDR/vn/) | [English](/problems/PALDR/en/)  
---|---  
  
Palindrome is a string that has the property of reading the same in either
direction (left to right or right to left). You are to determine whether a
given string can be expressed as a concatenation of palindromes of even
length.

Note: A string can be formed by concatenation of any number of even palindrome
strings.

### Input

First line contains T (T  < 100), the number of test cases. T lines
follow, each containing the string corresponding to that particular test case.

Note:

There might be a new-line character (i.e. '' in C++) at the end of each
line. Be careful with your languages.

### Output

Output consists of T lines, one corresponding to each test case. You
should output _YES_ if the string can be expressed as concatination of even
length palindromes and _NO_ otherwise.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    madam
    aA
    aabb
    
    Output:
    NO
    NO
    YES 
    

### Constraints

### **Statement**

Given a set of N integer A = {1, 2, 3, …, N} and a integer S, your task is
find a way to insert an operator ‘+’ or ‘-‘ to every neighbor pair of A, that
the result of the expression after insert equal to S.

### Input

A single line, N and S (1 ≤ N ≤ 500, |S| ≤ 125250)

### Output

If there are way(s) to insert, outputs any of them, otherwise outputs
“Impossible” (without quotes).

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    9 5
    
    Output:
    1-2+3-4+5-6+7-8+9
    
    
    Input:
    5 6
    
    Output:
    Impossible

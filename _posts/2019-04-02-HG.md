### **Statement**

RK has received a homework assignment to compute the greatest common
divisor of the two positive integers A and B. Since the numbers are
quite large, the professor provided him with N smaller integers whose
product is A , and M integers with product B.

RK would like to verify his result, so he has asked you to write a program to
solve his problem. If the result is more than 9 digits long, output only the
last 9 digits.

### Input

The first line of input contains the positive integer N (1  <= N <=
1000).

The second line of input contains N space-separated positive integers less
than 10^9, whose product is the number A.

The third line of input contains the positive integer M (1  <= M <=
1000).

The fourth line of input contains M space-separated positive integers less
than 10^9, whose product is the number B.

### Output

The first and only line of output must contain the greatest common divisor of
numbers A and B. If the result is more than 9 digits long, output only
the last (least significant) 9 digits.

### **Statement**

You are given 2 integers a, b. Find the number of i for which i! is divisble
by a but not b. if i! is divisible by a and b, then you should not count that
i.

### Input

One line that contains a and b.

### Output

Output the result in one line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2 3
    
    Output:
    1

### Constraints

    
    
     1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10<sup>7</sup>

### Explanation

2! is the only factorial which is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3.



#### **Solution**

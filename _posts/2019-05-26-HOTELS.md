### **Statement**

There are N hotels along the beautiful Adriatic coast. Each hotel has its
value in Euros.

Sroljo has won M Euros on the lottery. Now he wants to buy a sequence of
consecutive hotels, such that the sum of the values of these consecutive
hotels is as great as possible - but not greater than M.

You are to calculate this greatest possible total value.

### Input

In the first line of the input there are integers N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ 300 000, 1
≤ M < 2<sup>31</sup>).

In the next line there are N natural numbers less than 10<sup>6</sup>,
representing the hotel values in the order they lie along the coast.

### Output

Print the required number (it will be greater than 0 in all of the test data).

### Example

input  

    
    
    5 12
    2 1 3 4 5

output

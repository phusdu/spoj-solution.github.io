title:  IITWPC4H - Maggu and Cuteness of Strings
categories: ['uncategorized']

### **Statement**

Given two strings s and t of size n and m respectively. You can construct a
string w of size n+m using s and t such that it should contain both s and t as
its subsequences.  
  String w must satisfy this condition: For each character from 'a' to
'z', count of the character in w should be equal to sum of count in s and t.
Additionally every character of w must belong to the subsequence for either s
or t. 



eg. if s = ab and t = cd, Then w can be abcd, acbd, cdab, cabd, acdb, cadb.
Note that adcb is not correct, As t is not a subsequence in it.



“Cuteness value” of a string is defined as the maximum length of consecutive
equal characters in the string.



For all possible string w that you can construct, find out the maximum value
of “Cuteness value”.

### Input

First line contains T: number of test cases

For each test you case you are given a single line containing two space
separated strings s and t. (1 <= size (s), size (t) <= 10^5).

Both the strings s and t will have characters from 'a' to 'z' of English
alphabet only.

Note:Sum of length of all the input string is less than 5*10^6.

### Output

For each test case, output the answer as given in problem statement.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1  
     ab ab
    
    Output:
    2

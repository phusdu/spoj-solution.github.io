title:  KPRIMESB - Almost Prime Numbers Again
categories: ['uncategorized']
code: KPRIMESB

---

### **Statement**

Almost Prime Numbers are composite numbers which are not divisible by certain
prime numbers. Given K prime numbers and an integer N, find out the number of
Almost Prime Numbers (ie. composite numbers not divisible by any of the given
K prime numbers) that are not greater than N.

### Input

First line of input consists of an integer T (1 <=T<=1000), denoting the
number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each case begins with a
line containing two integers N (0 <=N<=10^6) and K (1 <=K<=10). The
next line contains K space separated prime numbers. All the prime numbers
are guaranteed to be less than 50.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line in the format Case X: Y , where
X denotes the test case number and Y denotes the number of Almost
Prime Numbers that are not greater than N.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    1000 3
    2 3 5
    49 3
    2 3 5
    
    
    Output:
    Case 1: 100
    Case 2: 1

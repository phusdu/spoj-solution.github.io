### **Statement**

Given a sequence of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000) integers S<sub>1</sub>, ...,
S<sub>N</sub> (0 ≤ S<sub>i</sub> < 1,000,000,000), compute the number
of distinct increasing subsequences of S with length K (1 ≤ K ≤ 50 and K ≤ N).

### Input

The first line contains the two integers N and K. The following N lines
contain the integers of the sequence in order.

### Output

Print a single integer representing the number of distinct increasing
subsequences of S of length K, modulo 5,000,000.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4 3
    1
    2
    2
    10
    
    Output:
    1
    

The only increasing subsequence of length 3 is 1, 2, 10.

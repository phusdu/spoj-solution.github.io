title:  FREQ2 - Most Frequent Value
categories: ['ad-hoc', 'sqrt-decomp']
code: FREQ2
src: FREQ2.cpp
---

### **Statement**

You are given a sequence of n integers a<sub>0</sub>,
a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n-1</sub>. You are also given several
queries consisting of indices i and j ( _0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n-1_ ). For each
query, determine the number of occurrences of the most frequent value among
the integers a<sub>i</sub>, ..., a<sub>j</sub>.

### Input

First line contains two integers n and q ( _1 ≤ n, q ≤ 100000_ ). The
next line contains n integers a<sub>0</sub>, ...
,a<sub>n-1</sub> ( _0 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 100000_ , for each _i ∈ {0,
..., n-1}_ ) separated by spaces. The following q lines contain one query
each, consisting of two integers i and j ( _0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n-1_ ), which
indicates the boundary indices for the query.

### Output

For each query, print one line with one integer: The number of occurrences of
the most frequent value within the given range.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
      
     5 3  
    1 2 1 3 3  
    0 2  
    1 2  
    0 4
    
    Output:
      
     2  
    1  
    2

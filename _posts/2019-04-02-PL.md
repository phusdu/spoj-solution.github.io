### **Statement**

Asad is a 10 years old boy. He loves to learn new logic from computer science.
[Palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) is an interesting topic
to him. So, He starts practicing to finding palindrome in his everyday life.

_A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which
reads the same backward as forward. such as – madam, 0001000 etc._

He faces a problem and asks for your help. You are a great programmer in our
country.Now, you have given a string _S_ . You have to do a permutation of
string _S_ through many times (can be 0 times) such that you will get a
palindromic string _P_ . You have to check whether it is possible to form a
palindrome after any permutation or not.

### Input

Every line of the input contains a single string _S_ .

#### Constraints:

  * _S_ will consist only of lowercase English letters (i.e. characters 'a' through 'z').
  * 1 ≤ _|S|_ ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>

### Output

For each test case, print a single line. Print 1, if it is possible to find at
least one valid permutation _P_ of string _S_ which is a palindrome. Otherwise
print -1.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    abc
    abab
    Output:
    -1
     1
    

### Note:

In, Case 2: ‘baab’ is a valid permutations of string ‘abab’ which is also a
palindrome. So output will be 1.

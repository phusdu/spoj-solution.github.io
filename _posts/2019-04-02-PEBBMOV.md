### **Statement**

A Game of Moving Pebbles

## Problem

Two players play the following game. At the beginning of the game they start
with n (1 <= n <=100000) piles of stones. At each step of the game,
the player chooses a pile and remove at least one stone from this pile and
move zero or more stones from this pile to any other pile that still has
stones. A player loses if he has no more possible moves. Given the initial
piles, determine who wins: the first player, or the second player, if both
play perfectly.

## The Input

Each line of input has integers 0 < n <= 100000, followed by n
positive integers denoting the initial piles.

## The Output

For each line of input, output "first player" if first player can force a win,
or "second player", if the second player can force a win.

## Sample Output

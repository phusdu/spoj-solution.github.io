### **Statement**

Let A = [a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,...,a<sub>n</sub>] be a
permutation of integers 1,2,...,n. A pair of indices (i,j), 1<=i<=j<=n, is an
_inversion_ of the permutation A if a<sub>i</sub> >a<sub>j</sub>. We
are given integers n>0 and k>=0. What is the number of n-element permutations
containing exactly k inversions?

For instance, the number of 4-element permutations with exactly 1 inversion
equals 3.

### Task

Write a program which for each data set from a sequence of several data sets:

  * reads integers n and k from input, 
  * computes the number of n-element permutations with exactly k inversions, 
  * writes the result to output. 

### Input

The first line of the input file contains one integer d, 1<=d<=10, which is
the number of data sets. The data sets follow. Each data set occupies one line
of the input file and contains two integers n (1<=n<=12) and k (0<=k<=98)
separated by a single space.

### Output

The i-th line of the output file should contain one integer - the number of
n-element permutations with exactly k inversions.

### Example

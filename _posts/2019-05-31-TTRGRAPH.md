### **Statement**

Today we continue examine topology of the ancient country GRAPH. It was said
that any four cities form a
[tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron) (or 4-vertex
[clique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_\(graph_theory\))) if from every
city of the tetrahedron there is a road to another tetrahedron city. In the
picture below is an example of tetrahedron.

_Theoretical note: all test cases
are[Erdős–Rényi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model)
connected low density graphs._

Your task is to find the number of tetrahedrons in the country.

### Input

The first line of input will contain one integer number _4 ≤ N ≤ 900_ , number
of cities in GRAPH. Follow _N_ lines. Each line represents cities (direct
neighbors) connected to the city number _i_ (cities numbering is zero based)
by one road.

### Output

Print number of tetrahedrons in the GRAPH.

### Example

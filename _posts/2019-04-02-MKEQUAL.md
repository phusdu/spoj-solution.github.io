### **Statement**

You have an array containing N elements. At any move, you choose two
indices i and j ( 0  <= i , j < N and i != j ) and
increment value at one index and decrement value at other index. You can make
this move any number of times. What is the maximum number of elements which
can have the same value (after any number of moves) ?

### Input

First line consists of T , the number of test cases. (1 <= T <= 100)

T sets follow. Each set contains N , the number of elements in the
array, in the first line. (1 <= N <= 100000)

Next line of each set consists of N space separated integers (0  <= value
<= 100000)

### Output

Output T lines each containing the required answer.

### **Statement**

You are given a matrix M of type 1234x5678. It is initially filled with
integers 1...1234x5678 in row major order. Your task is to process a list of
commands manipulating M. There are 4 types of commands:  
"R x y" swap the x-th and y-th row of M ;  
"C x y" swap the x-th and y-th column of M ;  
"Q x y" write out M(x,y) ;  
"W z" write out x and y where z=M(x,y).

### Input

A list of valid commands. Input terminated by EOF.

### Output

For each "Q x y" write out one line with the current value of M(x,y), for each
"W z" write out one line with the value of x and y ( interpreted as above )
separated by a space.

    
    
    Input:
    R 1 2
    Q 1 1
    Q 2 1
    W 1
    W 5679
    C 1 2
    Q 1 1
    Q 2 1
    W 1
    W 5679
    
    Output:
    5679
    1
    2 1
    1 1
    5680
    2
    2 2
    1 2

### **Statement**

<strong>CODER SANJAY</strong> is now ready to put up his first problem in his
favorrite website <strong>SPOJ</strong>.As it is his first problem,he wanted
it to be easy so that most of them could get an <strong>AC</strong>.

The problem statement looks like this:

<p>

<br><strong>F(x)</strong> is a function whose properties are as follows.</br>

<p>1.<strong>F(x)=0</strong> at x=0.</p>

<p>2.<strong>F(x)=1</strong> at x=1.</p>

<p>3.<strong>F(x)=2</strong> at x=2.</p>

<p>4.<strong>F(x)=0</strong> if x is odd prime.</p>

<p>5.<strong>F(ab)=F(a)+F(b)</strong>,where a,b are two positive integers and
sum of a and b is minimum.</br>

</p>

<br>Your task is simple.You are to output the value of <strong>F(x)</strong>
for the given input integer <strong>x</strong>. </br>

Input

The only line of input contains a single integer <strong>x</strong>.

Output

Output the value of <strong>F(x)</strong>

Example

Input:

<p>

4

### **Statement**

### Problem Statement

You are initially given an array of N integers ( 1<=N<=10<sup>5</sup> ).
Given this array, you have to perform 2 kinds of operations :  
  
(i) Operation 1 : Op1( l, r )  
  
You are given 2 integers l and r. ( 1 <= l <= r <= current size of the array
). You need to return the sum of all the elements with indices between l and r
( both inclusive ). That is, if the elements currently in the array are
a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>.... a<sub>n</sub>,
you need to return the following sum : a<sub>l</sub> + a<sub>l+1</sub>
+ a<sub>l+2</sub> ... + a<sub>r</sub>.  
  
(ii) Operation 2 : Op2( x )  
  
You are given a single integer x ( |x| <= 10<sup>9</sup> ). Add this
element to the beginning of the array. After this operation, x will now become
a<sub>1</sub>, the old a<sub>1</sub> will now become
a<sub>2</sub>, and so on. The size of the array will increase by 1.

### Input

The first line contains a single integer N ( 1 <= N <= 10<sup>5</sup> ),
the number of elements initially in the array.  
  
This is followed by a line containing N space separated integers,
a<sub>1</sub> a<sub>2</sub> .... a<sub>N</sub>. (
|a<sub>i</sub>| <= 10<sup>9</sup> )  
  
The next line contains a single integer Q, the number of operations you will
be asked to perform. ( 1 <= Q <= 10<sup>5</sup> )  
  
Q lines of input follow. Each such line starts with either the number 1 or the
number 2. This indicates the type of operation that you are required to
perform. The format of these queries are as follows :  
  
1 l r : Carry out operation 1 with arguments l and r. ( 1 <= l <= r <= current
size of the array )  
That is, return the sum of the following array elements : a<sub>l</sub> +
a<sub>l+1</sub> ... + a<sub>r</sub>  
  
2 x : Carry out operation 2 with the argument x. ( |x| <= 10<sup>9</sup> )  
That is, add the value x at the beginning of the array.

### Output

For each query of type 1, output the return value on a new line. No output
needs to be printed for queries of type 2.

### Example

    
    
    Input #1:
    10  
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
    4  
    1 1 10  
    1 1 1  
    1 10 10  
    1 2 7  
      
     Output #1:  
     55  
    1  
    10  
    27  
       
      
    Input #2:  
     5  
    6 7 8 9 10  
    9  
    2 5  
    2 4  
    1 2 7  
    2 3  
    2 2  
    2 1  
    1 1 10  
    1 1 1  
    1 10 10  
       
      
    Output #2:  
     45  
    55  
    1  
    10

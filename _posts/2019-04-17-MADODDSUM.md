### **Statement**

Hablu likes odd numbers a lot. So he wants the sum of all odd numbers in range
[a, b]. That is, find the sum of all odd numbers i such that (a ≤ i ≤ b).
Seems easy right? Because it is.

### Input

The first and only line will contain 2 integers a, b where (0 ≤ a ≤
10<sup>8</sup>) and (0 ≤ b ≤ 10<sup>8</sup>).

### Output

In one line, output the value of the sum

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    0 9
    
    Output:
    25

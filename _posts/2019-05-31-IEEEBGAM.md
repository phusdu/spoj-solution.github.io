### **Statement**

Taru and Hanaku play a ball game. The game is played with N white balls, N
black balls and N boxes. Hanaku chooses one box randomly and one ball from it
randomly. Taru has to arrange the balls in such a way that the probability of
Hanaku choosing a White ball is maximised. None of the boxes after the
arrangement should be empty. Your task is to find that maximum probability.

### Input

The first line contains the number of test cases (T) followed by T lines each
an integer N.

### Output

For each test case output the maximum probability of getting a white ball
which is possible with an arrangement for the above configuration. Print the
answer rounded to 8 decimal places.

### Constraints

T <= 20  
N <= 1000

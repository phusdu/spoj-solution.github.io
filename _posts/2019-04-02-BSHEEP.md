title:  BSHEEP - Build the Fence
categories: ['convex-hull']
code: BSHEEP
src: BSHEEP.cpp
---

### **Statement**

At the beginning of spring all the sheep move to the higher pastures in the
mountains. If there are thousands of them, it is well worthwhile gathering
them together in one place. But sheep don't like to leave their grass-lands.
Help the shepherd and build him a fence which would surround all the sheep.
The fence should have the smallest possible length! Assume that sheep are
negligibly small and that they are not moving. Sometimes a few sheep are
standing in the same place. If there is only one sheep, it is probably dying,
so no fence is needed at all...

### Input

  
t [the number of tests <= 100]  
[empty line]  
n [the number of sheep <= 100000]  
_x_ <sub>1</sub> _y_ <sub>1</sub> [coordinates of the first sheep]  
...  
_x<sub>n</sub>_ _y<sub>n</sub>_  
[integer coordinates from -10000 to 10000]  
[empty line]  
[other lists of sheep]  
  
Text grouped in [ ] does not appear in the input file. Assume that sheep are
numbered in the input order.

### Output

  
o [length of circumference, rounded to 2 decimal places]  
p1 p2 ... pk  
[the sheep that are standing in the corners of the fence; the first one should
be positioned bottommost and as far to the left as possible, the others ought
to be written in anticlockwise order; ignore all sheep standing in the same
place but the first to appear in the input file; the number of sheep should be
the smallest possible]

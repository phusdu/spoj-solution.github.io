### **Statement**

The whole world is crazy about subset sum. We define subset sum as sum of all
subparts. A subpart is a number which is obtained by erasing certain digits
and arranging the remaining numbers in the same order. You have to calculate
the subset sum of the given number. Since the number can be very large return
the subset sum modulo m.

For example if the number is 1357, then the various subparts are 1, 3, 5, 7,
13, 15, 17, 35, 37, 57, 137, 135, 157, 357, 1357 .

### Input

First line contains T (1  ≤ T ≤ 50) denoting the number of test
cases.

Next T lines containing two numbers n (0 < n < 10<sup>1000</sup>)
and m (1 < m < 10<sup>9</sup>).

### Output

Print the subset sum modulo m.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
    6
    
    
    111 9
    
    
    111 200
    
    
    456 9
    
    
    456 1000
    
    
    1357 1000
    
    
    1357 5000
    
    
    Output:
    
    
    3
    
    
    147
    
    
    6
    
    
    618
    
    
    333
    
    
    2333

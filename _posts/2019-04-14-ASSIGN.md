### **Statement**

### Problem

Your task will be to calculate number of different assignments of n different
topics to n students such that everybody gets exactly one topic he likes.

### Input

First line of input contains number of test cases c (1<=c<=80). Each test case
begins with number of students n (1<=n<=20). Each of the next n lines contains
n integers describing preferences of one student. 1 at the ith position means
that this student likes ith topic, 0 means that he definitely doesn't want to
take it.

### Output

For each test case output number of different assignments (it will fit in a
signed 64-bit integer).

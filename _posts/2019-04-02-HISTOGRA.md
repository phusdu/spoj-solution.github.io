title:  HISTOGRA - Largest Rectangle in a Histogram
categories: ['ad-hoc-1']
code: HISTOGRA
src: HISTOGRA.cpp

### **Statement**

A histogram is a polygon composed of a sequence of rectangles aligned at a
common base line. The rectangles have equal widths but may have different
heights. For example, the figure on the left shows the histogram that consists
of rectangles with the heights 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3, measured in units where 1
is the width of the rectangles:

Usually, histograms are used to represent discrete distributions, e.g., the
frequencies of characters in texts. Note that the order of the rectangles,
i.e., their heights, is important. Calculate the area of the largest rectangle
in a histogram that is aligned at the common base line, too. The figure on the
right shows the largest aligned rectangle for the depicted histogram.

### Input Specification

The input contains several test cases. Each test case describes a histogram
and starts with an integer `n`, denoting the number of rectangles it is
composed of. You may assume that `1 <= n <= 100000`. Then follow `n` integers
`h<sub>1</sub>, ..., h<sub>n</sub>`, where `0 <= h<sub>i</sub> <=
1000000000`. These numbers denote the heights of the rectangles of the
histogram in left-to-right order. The width of each rectangle is `1`. A zero
follows the input for the last test case.

### Output Specification

For each test case output on a single line the area of the largest rectangle
in the specified histogram. Remember that this rectangle must be aligned at
the common base line.

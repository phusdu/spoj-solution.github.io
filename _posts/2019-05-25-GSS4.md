title:  GSS4 - Can you answer these queries IV
categories: ['tree']
code: GSS4
src: GSS4.cpp

### **Statement**

You are given a sequence A of N(N <= 100,000) positive integers. There sum
will be less than 10<sup>18</sup>. On this sequence you have to apply M (M
<= 100,000) operations:

(A) For given x,y, for each elements between the x-th and the y-th ones
(inclusively, counting from 1), modify it to its positive square root (rounded
down to the nearest integer).

(B) For given x,y, query the sum of all the elements between the x-th and the
y-th ones (inclusively, counting from 1) in the sequence.

### Input

Multiple test cases, please proceed them one by one. Input terminates by EOF.

For each test case:

The first line contains an integer N. The following line contains N integers,
representing the sequence A<sub>1</sub>..A<sub>N</sub>.  
The third line contains an integer M. The next M lines contain the operations
in the form "i x y".i=0 denotes the modify operation, i=1 denotes the query
operation.

### Output

For each test case:

Output the case number (counting from 1) in the first line of output. Then for
each query, print an integer as the problem required.

Print an blank line after each test case.

See the sample output for more details.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    5
    1 2 3 4 5
    5
    1 2 4
    0 2 4
    1 2 4
    0 4 5
    1 1 5
    4
    10 10 10 10
    3
    1 1 4
    0 2 3
    1 1 4
    
    Output:
    Case #1:
    9
    4
    6
    
    Case #2:
    40
    26

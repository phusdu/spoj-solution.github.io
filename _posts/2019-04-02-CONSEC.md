### **Statement**

You are given a string S containing only uppercase English letters. There are
Q queries. Each query can be of two types,

  * 1 i: Find the maximum size of the segment [b, e] where 0 ≤ b ≤ i ≤ e < |S| and substring S[b...e] contains only the letter S[i]. A Substring is a contiguous sequences of characters in a string.

  * 2 i: Change the character in index i with the character ‘#’.

  
For both type of queries, S[i] will not contain the character ‘#’.The
characters of the string are indexed from 0.

Input

The first line contains number of test cases T (1 ≤ T ≤ 15).

For each test cases, the first line contains the string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 200000).
The 2nd line contains number of queries Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000). Each of the next Q
lines contains one query in the format mentioned in the problem statement.

Output

For each test case, first print the test case number and output of every query
of type 1 in a single line.

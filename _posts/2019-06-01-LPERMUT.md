### **Statement**

You are given a sequence A of n integer numbers (1<=A<sub>i</sub><=n). A
subsequence of A has the form A<sub>u</sub>, A<sub>u+1</sub> ... ,
A<sub>v</sub> (1<=u<=v<=n). We are interested in subsequences that are
permutations of 1, 2, .., k (k is the length of the subsequence).

Your task is to find the longest subsequence of this type.

### Input

  * Line 1: n (1<=n<=100000) 
  * Line 2: n numbers A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ... ,A<sub>n</sub> (1<=A<sub>i</sub><=n) 

### Output

A single integer that is the length of the longest permutation

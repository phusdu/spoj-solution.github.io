### **Statement**

---|---  
      
    
    Little John is playing very funny game with his younger brother. There  is 
    one big box filled with M&Ms of different colors. At first John has 
    to eat several M&Ms of the same color. Then his opponent has to make a turn. 
    And so on. Please note that each player has to eat at least one M&M 
    during his turn. If John (or his brother) will eat the last M&M from the 
    box he will be considered as a looser and he will have to buy a new candy box. 
    
    Both of players are using optimal game strategy. John starts first always. 
    You will be given information about M&Ms and your task is to determine a 
    winner of such a beautiful game.
    

### Input

    
    
    The first line of input will contain a single integer T – the number of 
    test cases. Next T pairs of lines will describe tests in a following format. 
    The first line of each test will contain an integer N – 
    the amount of 
    different M&M colors in a box. Next line will contain N integers Ai, 
    separated by spaces – amount of M&Ms of i-th color. 
    Constrains: 
    1 <= T <= 474, 
    1 <= N <= 47, 
    1 <= Ai <= 4747
    

### Output

### **Statement**

Chip and Dale have devised an encryption method to hide their (written) text
messages. They first agree secretly on two numbers that will be used as the
number of rows (R) and columns (C) in a matrix. The sender encodes an
intermediate format using the following rules:

  1. The text is formed with uppercase letters [A-Z] and . 
  2. Each text character will be represented by decimal values as follows: 

` = 0, A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Y = 25, Z = 26`

The sender enters the 5 digit binary representation of the characters’ values
in a spiral pattern along the matrix as shown below. The matrix is padded out
with zeroes (0) to fill the matrix completely. For example, if the text to
encode is: "ACM" and R=4 and C=4, the matrix would be filled in as follows:

    A = 00001, C = 00011, M = 01101
             (one extra 0)

The bits in the matrix are then concatenated together in row major order and
sent to the receiver. The example above would be encoded as: 0000110100101100

### Input

The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) which is
the number of datasets that follow.

Each dataset consists of a single line of input containing R (1<=R<=20), a
space, C (1<=C<=20), a space, and a string of binary digits that represents
the contents of the matrix (R * C binary digits). The binary digits are in row
major order.

### Output

For each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following
values: The dataset number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a
space, and the decoded text message. You should throw away any trailing spaces
and/or partial characters found while decoding.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4
    4 4 0000110100101100
    5 2 0110000010
    2 6 010000001001
    5 5 0100001000011010110000010
    
    Output:
    1 ACM
    2 HI
    3 HI
    4 HI HO

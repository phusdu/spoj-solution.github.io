### **Statement**

Jerry is a meritorious student of Varendra University. She always
loves fantasy. Now she  
wants to go to MALDIVES which one of the world’s most beautiful countries,
and a lot of  
her friends live there. Now she gets an offer from an airline company. The
offer is Jerry  
can take only a friend from BANGLADESH without paying any ticket cost if
and only if her  
friend’s name’s value is divisible by 3 (the mysterious number). Read a name
and calculate  
the value for that name. The value is calculated by adding ASCII values of
all of the  
characters in a name.  

### Input

The first line in the data set is an integer T (1 <=T<=100) that
represents the number of  
names that follow. Each name is on a separate line. The maximum name length is
70  
characters (without any space)  

### Output

Print “ Yes ” if her friend can go with her, otherwise print “ No ”.
The output is to be  
formatted exactly like that for the sample output given below.

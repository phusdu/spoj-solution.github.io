### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug has two string which she wants to give to her friends. As she
doesn't want to distinguish between them, she wants to use only some common
subsequence. Firstly she wanted to simply use the longest common subsequence
but then she realized it wouldn't be _kosher_.

She assigned a positive value to each letter. Now she wants to find the most
expensive subsequence.

### Input

The first line of each test-case will contain two integers 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2000
, the length of each subsequence.

The next line will contain 26 integers ( 1 ≤ P<sub>i</sub> ≤
10<sup>5</sup> ), the price of each letter.

The next line will contain string of length N consisting of lowercase
english alphabet.

The next line will contain string of length M consisting of lowercase
english alphabet.

### Output

For each test-case, print the cost of the most expensive common subsequence.

### **Statement**

I really enjoy setting problem [GUESSING](/problems/GUESSING/). After three
years, I decided to set another "kind of interactive" problem based on it.

Given a link for GUESSING problem, find the server's response

### Specification

The script runs on server works like this, the URL contains 12 digits, first 6
digits represents SEED generated by random number generator, and it won't
change during a guessing session. The last 6 digits represents GUESS ,
which is the number user just typed.

The unknown part (for you, of course) is an integer function f which is a
bijection from [0,999999] to [0,999999].

The server first generate TARGET = f ( SEED ), then it compares
TARGET and GUESS and give response back to user.

for more details on f , it's in format (expr(x) % 1000000), and expr (x)
is a expression contains only operation add, subtract, multiply, division,
modulo, each exactly once , and every constants are in [0,999999], every
variable is x(of course), brackets are allowed.

for example, expr(x) could be "x/12-34%(x+1)*56", but it's invalid since f
is not a bijection.

the modulo/division operations here works well if left side is a negative
number, for example, -2 % 5 = 3, -2 / 5 = -1. but it's undefined if the number
on the right side is not positive.

### Input

each line contains a link in format
"`http://www.spoj.com/problems/GUESSING/XXXXXXYYYYYY/`", where `XXXXXXYYYYYY`
contains exactly 12 digit.

### Output

The server's response, in format "`XAYB`".

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    [http://www.spoj.com/problems/GUESSING/123456123456/](/problems/GUESSING/123456123456/)
    [http://www.spoj.com/problems/GUESSING/000000000000/](/problems/GUESSING/000000000000/)
    
    Output:
    1A3B
    1A5B

### **Statement**

Maggu was teaching vectors using triangle diagrams to to his little brother.
Now in the midst of lesson he went for a coffee and on returning finds all his
triangles disassembled into constituent vectors by his naughty brother. He
needs to recreate the triangles. He needs your help in doing this task quickly
as he has to go for an internship interview.

### Input

First line will contain T (1 <= T <= 10), the number of test cases. Each test
case will consist of first line N, number of vectors. Next line will contain N
(1 <= N <= 1000) vectors of the form of a b -1000<=a,b<=1000.

### Output

You have to print, in a new line for every test case, “YES” if any 3 vectors
among N form a triangle, “NO” otherwise.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     3
    5 
    
    
    3 4 3 -4 5 0 6 0 3 5
    
    
    2
    
    
    4 5 -4 -5
    
    
    3 
    
    
    1 2 3 4 -5 -6
    
    
    Output:  
    
    
     YES
    
    
    NO
    NO

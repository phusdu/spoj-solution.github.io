### **Statement**

We wish to tile a grid 4 units high and _N_ units long with rectangles
(dominoes) 2 units by one unit (in either orientation). For example, the
figure shows the five different ways that a grid 4 units high and 2 units wide
may be tiled.

Write a program that takes as input the width, _W_ , of the grid and
outputs the number of different ways to tile a 4-by- _ W_ grid.

### Input

The first line of input contains a single integer _N_ , (1 ≤ _N_ ≤
1000) which is the number of datasets that follow.

Each dataset contains a single decimal integer, the width, _W_ , of the
grid for this problem instance.

### Output

For each problem instance, there is one line of output: The problem instance
number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a single space and the
number of tilings of a 4-by- _ W_ grid. The values of _W_ will be
chosen so the count will fit in a 32-bit integer.

### Example

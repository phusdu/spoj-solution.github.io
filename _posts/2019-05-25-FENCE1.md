title:  FENCE1 - Build a Fence
categories: ['math']
code: FENCE1
src: FENCE1.cpp

### **Statement**

There is a wall in your backyard. It is so long that you canâ€™t see its
endpoints. You want to build a fence of length _L_ such that the area enclosed
between the wall and the fence is maximized. The fence can be of arbitrary
shape, but only its two endpoints may touch the wall.

### Input

The input consists of several test cases.

For every test case, there is only one integer _L_ (1 <= _L_ <=100),
indicating the length of the fence.

The input ends with _L_ =0.

### Output

For each test case, output one line containing the largest area. Your answer
should be rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    0
    
    Output:
    0.16

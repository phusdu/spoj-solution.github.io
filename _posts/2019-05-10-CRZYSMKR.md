### **Statement**

The "BHAI Group" Of Every College is Famous For Many Things.

So One Day The Leader Of Bhai Group decided to smoke C(N) cigarettes each
day:

\- F(N) = 34<sup>N</sup> \+ (30 x N) + 32

\- C(N) = F(N) mod (11), where x mod (y) is the remainder obtained by
diving x by y.

But Bhai Group's Leader's girlfriend wants that he doesn't smoke any
cigarette, so she made modifications:

\- F(N) = 34<sup>N</sup> \+ (30 x N) + (32 + M)

\- C(N) = F(N) mod (11)

Input

First line of each test case is an integer T, total number of test cases.
Next T lines contains a single integer N.

Output

Print the minimum value of M in single line for each test case.

Constraints<br>

<b>

\- 1 <= T <= 10<sup>6</sup>

\- 1 <= N <= 10<sup>18</sup>

The "BHAI Group" Of IIIT Allahabad is Famous For Many Things,Leading In
Every Field Of College Activity

So One Day The Leader Of Bhai Group decided to smoke C(N) cigarettes
each day:

\- _F(N) = 34^N+ (30 x N) + 32_

\- _C(N) = F(N) mod (11)_ , where x mod (y) is the remainder
obtained by diving x by y.

But Bha i Group's Leader's Girlfriend wants that he doesn't smoke any
cigarette, so she made modifications:

_- F(N) = 34^N+ (30 x N) + (32 + M)_

_- C(N) = F(N) mod (11)_

### Input

First line of each test case is an integer T , total number of test cases.
Next T lines contains a single integer N.

### Output

Print the minimum value of M in single line for each test case.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10^6

1 <= N <= 10^18

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
    
    2
    1
    2

Output:

    
    
    3
    6

Explaination :

    
    
    _For N = 1
    F(N) = 34 + 30 + 32 = 96
    So, M = 3
    Now, C(N) = 99 mod(11) = 0
    For N = 2
    F(N) = 1156 + 60 + 32 = 1248
    So, M = 6
    Now, C(N) = 1254 mod(11) = 0_

### **Statement**

The n^2 upper bound for any sorting algorithm  
is easy to obtain: just take two elements  
that are misplaced with respect to each other  
and swap them. Conrad conceived an algorithm  
that proceeds by taking not two, but three misplaced  
elements. That is, take three elements  
ai > aj > ak with i < j < k and place them in  
order ak; aj ; ai. Now if for the original algorithm  
the steps are bounded by the maximum number  
of inversions n(n-1)/2, Conrad is at his wits' end as  
to the upper bound for such triples in a given sequence. He asks you to write
a program  
that counts the number of such triples.

### Input

The rst line of the input is the length of the sequence, 1 <= n <= 10^5.  
The next line contains the integer sequence a1; a2..an.  
You can assume that all ai belongs [1; n].

### Output

Output the number of inverted triples.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4  
     3 3 2 1
    Output:
    2

### **Statement**

In front of Super Mario there are 10 mushrooms , arranged in a row. A
certain amount of points is awarded for picking each of the mushrooms. Super
Mario must pick mushrooms in order they appear, but is not required to
pick them all â€“ his goal is to score a number of points as close as possible
to 100.

In case there exist two such numbers which are equally close to 100 (e.g. 98
and 102), Mario will pick the greater one (in this case 102).

Help Super Mario and tell him how many points he will score.

### Input

Input consists of 10 lines, each of which contains one positive integer less
than or equal to 100, denoting the scores awarded for picking each mushroom,
in the order that Mario can pick them in.

### Output

The first and only line of output must contain the required number of points.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    10
    20
    30
    40

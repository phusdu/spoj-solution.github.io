### **Statement**

We define the LEVEL of a triangle as in the following illustrative image:

And we continue defining the LEVEL of a hexagon. It's called level N hexagon
if it’s joined by 6 triangles, each one is a level N triangle.

Task: All you have to do is to count all triangles in the “level N”
hexagon.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases
and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N which is the level of the
hexagon in that test case.

### Output

For each test case, you should write a seperate line: the number of triangles
in the “level N” hexagon. (All answers will fit within the range of a 64-bit
positive integer)

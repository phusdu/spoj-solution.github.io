title:  FIBOSUM2 - Fibonacci extraction Sum
categories: ['uncategorized']
code: FIBOSUM2
src: FIBOSUM2.cpp
---

### **Statement**

Some people may found [FIBOSUM](http://www.spoj.com/problems/FIBOSUM/) a too
easy problem. We propose here a useful variation.

![SigmaFibScale](../../content/francky:sigmaFibScale)

Fib is the Fibonacci sequence: For any positive integer i: if i<2 Fib(i) = i,
else Fib(i) = Fib(i-1) + Fib(i-2)

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer _T_ , the number of test
cases. On each of the next _T_ lines, your are given tree integers _c_
, _k_ , _N_.

### Output

Print Sum(Fib( _ki+c_ ) for _i_ in [1.. _N_ ]). As the answer could not
fit in a 64-bit container, just output your answer modulo 1000000007.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    3 5 2
    
    
    
    Output:
    254
    

### Explanations

Index-1 Fib sequence : 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 , 34, 55, 89, 144, 233
, 377, 610, 987, ... We want the 5*1+3 = 8<sup>th</sup> and 5*2+3 =
13<sup>th</sup> ones, thus the answer is 21 + 233 = 254.

### Constraints

    
    
    0 < T <= 60606
    0 <= c < k <= 2^15
    0 < N <= 10^18
    

The numbers _c,k,N_ are uniform randomly chosen in their range. For your
information, constraints allow 1.3kB of Python3 code to get AC in 6.66s, it
could be hard. A fast C-code can get AC under 0.15s. Warning: Here is
Pyramid cluster, you can try the [tutorial
edition](http://www.spoj.com/problems/FIBOSUMT/) (clone with Cube cluster).
Have fun ;-)

Edit(2017-02-11) : With compiler changes, my fast C code ends in 0.01s, my
Python3 ones in 0.31s. New TL is 0.5s.

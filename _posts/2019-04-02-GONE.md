### **Statement**

The War of Evil vs Good continues and Ra-One and G-One continue to be on
respective sides.

After saving all the cities with [Ra-One
Numbers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/RAONE/) G-One realised that some cities
whose population is a "G-One Number" can be easy target for Ra-One.

A G-One number is a number sum of whose digits is a prime number

For eg. 12 .. sum = 1+2 =3 ... 3 is a prime number.

G-One wants to find out all the populations which can be g-One numbers....

Can You help Him.?

You will be given the range of population and you have to tell him how many in
this range are G-One Numbers.

### Input

first line has number 'c' indicating the number of ranges.

'c' lines follow and contain two numbers ..... 'f' and 't' inclusive.

### Output

Print a single line per case giving the number of populations which are G-One
numbers.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3  
     10 19  
    1 9  
    20 29  
      
      
    Â Output:
      
     4  
    4  
    5  
      
     Note : c will be less than 100  
    t and f will be less than 10^8 inclusive

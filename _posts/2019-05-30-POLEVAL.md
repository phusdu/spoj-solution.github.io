### **Statement**

Your task consists of evaluate a polynomial of degree n ( 0 <= n
<= 999 ) represented by its n+1 coefficients of the form:

p<sub>n</sub>(x) = c<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup> +
c<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup> + … +
c<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + c<sub>1</sub>x + c<sub>0</sub>

in each one of the k ( 1 <= k <= 100 ) points
x<sub>1</sub> , x<sub>2</sub> , …, x<sub>k</sub>. The
coefficients of the polynomial and the values where they will be evaluated are
integers in the interval [-100, 100] that guarantees that the polynomial's
evaluation is at the most 2<sup>63</sup> – 1.

### Input

There will be multiple test cases, each one with 4 lines that are
described below  
n : degree of polynomial.  
c<sub>n</sub> c<sub>n-1 </sub>… c<sub>2 </sub> c<sub>1</sub>
c<sub>0</sub> : coefficients of the polynomial separated by a single
space.  
k : number of points to evaluate the polynomial.  
x<sub>1</sub> x<sub>2 </sub>…<sub> </sub> x<sub>k-1</sub>
x<sub>k</sub> : points to evaluate the polynomial separated by a single
space.  
  
The final test case is a single line where n = -1 and this case should not
be processed.

### Output

For each test case you should print k + 1 lines of output, the very first
line containing the case number and the following k lines with the result
of the polynomial's evaluation in each one of the k given points. See the
sample.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2  
     1 -2 -1  
    5  
    0 1 -1 2 -2  
    3  
    2 1 -2 -1  
    4  
    0 -1 2 -2  
    -1  
    
    Output:
    Case 1:  
     -1  
    -2  
    2  
    -1  
    7  
    Case 2:  
    -1  
    0  
    15  
    -9

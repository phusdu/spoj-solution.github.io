### **Statement**

Once Gopu was reading a maths problem which had a weird looking function f as
follows.

{  
1, if n is a prime number.  
 f(n) = f (sum of prime divisors of n) + number of distinct prime divisors
of n, otherwise.  
}

Compute f (n) for a given value of n.

### Input

First line contains T : number of test cases. (1 <= T <= 20)

For each test case, there is a single line containing integer n. (2 <= n <=
10^12).

### Output

For each test case, output value of f (n) in a single line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    6  
     2  
    3  
    4  
    5  
    20  
    123456Â 
    
    
    Output:  
     1  
    1  
    2  
    1  
    3  
    6

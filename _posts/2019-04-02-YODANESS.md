### **Statement**

![](https://www.spoj.com/content/spookycookie:yoda)Yoda is the wisest, and
perhaps the most powerful Jedi of his time. Yoda is a mysterious figure and he
has many oddities. One of them is that Yoda often changes the order of words
in the sentence. For example, one of such phrases is "Or I will help you not."
Let's call the yodaness level of any statement the number of pairs of words
that changed their order, as to the order in which they were supposed to go in
a normal statement. Write a program that determines the yodaness level of
different statement of Yoda.

### Input

The first line of input contains the number t - the number of tests. Next
comes the description of t tests. Each test consists of three rows. The first
line of the test contains an integer n - number of words in the statement. The
next line contains n words separated by spaces - the statement as Yoda says
it. The next line is n words separated by spaces - the same statement as it
should be said normally. All the words in the statement are different and
consist of small latin letters.

### Constraints

1 <= t <= 10  
1 <= n <= 30000  
the length of each word does not exceed 20 characters

### Output

For each test print the yodaness level of the statement.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    6
    in the force strong you are
    you are strong in the force
    6
    or i will help you not
    or i will not help you
    
    Output:
    11

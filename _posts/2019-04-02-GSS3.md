### **Statement**

You are given a sequence A of N (N <= 50000) integers between -10000 and
10000. On this sequence you have to apply M (M <= 50000) operations:  
modify the i-th element in the sequence or for given x y print max{Ai + Ai+1 +
.. + Aj | x<=i<=j<=y }.

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer N. The following line contains N
integers, representing the sequence A1..AN.  
The third line contains an integer M. The next M lines contain the operations
in following form:  
0 x y: modify Ax into y (|y|<=10000).  
1 x y: print max{Ai + Ai+1 + .. + Aj | x<=i<=j<=y }.  

### Output

For each query, print an integer as the problem required.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4
    1 2 3 4
    4
    1 1 3
    0 3 -3
    1 2 4
    1 3 3
    
    Output:
    6
    4
    -3

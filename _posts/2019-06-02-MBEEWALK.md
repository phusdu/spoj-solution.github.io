### **Statement**

[English](/problems/MBEEWALK/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/MBEEWALK/vn/)  
---|---  
      
    
    A bee larva living in a hexagonal cell of a large honey comb decides to creep 
    for a walk. In each “step” the larva may move into any of the six adjacent cells
    and after n steps, it is to end up in its original cell.
    Your program has to compute, for a given n, the number of different such larva walks.

### Input

    
    
    The ﬁrst line contains an integer giving the number of test cases to follow. 
    Each case consists of one line containing an integer n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 14.

### Output

    
    
     
    For each test case, output one line containing the number of walks. Under the
    assumption 1 ≤ n ≤ 14, the answer will be less than 2^31.

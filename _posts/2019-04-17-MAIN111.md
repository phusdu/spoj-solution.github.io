### **Statement**

Tim defines an integer as "Strictly not a Prime", if no
subsequence(considering the integer as a string of digits) of the integer is a
prime. He needs your help in finding how many such integers are present
between two given integers A and B(including A and B).

### Input

First line contains an integer T(1 <= T <= 100000) which denotes the total
number test cases. Each test case consists of two integers A and B (1 <= A, B
<= 100000) on a single line.

### Output

For each test case, print the total count of integers which are "Strictly not
a prime" between A and B(including A and B) as per tim.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    
    
    3 6
    
    
    7 10
    
    
    Output:
    2

categories: ['uncategorized']
code: KNMD
src: KNMD.cpp

### **Statement**

You are given sequence _A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ...
A<sub>n</sub>_ and integer _k_. For each integer _i_ _(0 ≤ i < k)_ find
such nonempty subsequence of _A_ so that sum of numbers in this
subsequence is maximal possible and remainder of integer division of this sum
by _k_ is equal to _i_.

### Input

In first line numbers _n_ and _k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>, 1 ≤ k ≤ 200)_.

In second line: _n_ numbers representing sequence _A (1 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤
10<sup>9</sup>)_.

### Output

Print _k_ numbers in one line. _i_ 'th number represent sum of numbers in
subsequence for number _i - 1_. If there is no such subsequence print -1.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    6 5
    2 8 10 44 15 32
    Output:
    65 111 77 103 109

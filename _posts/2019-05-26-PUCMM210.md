### **Statement**

f(n) is defined as: f(n) =
1<sup>3</sup>+2<sup>3</sup>+3<sup>3</sup>+...+n<sup>3</sup>,
so it is the sum of the cubes of all natural numbers up to n.

In this problem you are about to compute,

f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ... + f(n)

### Input

The first line is an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100,000), denoting the number
of test cases. Then, T test cases follow.

For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000) written
in one line.

### Output

For each test case output the result of the summatory function described
above.

Since this number could be very large, output the answer modulo 1,000,000,003.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     3  
    2  
    10  
    3  
      
     Output:  
     10  
    7942  
    46

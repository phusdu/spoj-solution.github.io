### **Statement**

Given a number n, Find out what max possible number you can make by deleting
exactly k digits.

T : no of test cases <= 10^3

1 <= no of digits in n <= 10^5. (n might contain leading zeros)

0 <= k <= n

if value of n is equal to k. then just print a new line.

Input

T: no of test cases

T line follow

every line has

n , k

### Output

max possible number

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
    2
    
    
    1223 2

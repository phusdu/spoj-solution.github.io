### **Statement**

Pigeon SSNA want to build a tower with some wood walls. Let's describe the
tower they want to make:

  1. A Tower can consist of different number of level.
  2. If a tower contain L levels then 1<sup>st</sup> level must contain L holes , 2<sup>nd</sup> level L-1 , 3<sup>rd</sup> level L-2 ….. L level contain 1 hole .
  3. Each room contain 3 wood walls.

Now pigeon SSNA has n wood walls. What is maximum number of level he can
made.

### Input

Input starts with an integer T (≤ 100000), denoting the number of test
cases.

Each case starts with a line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤
10<sup>12</sup>)

### Output

For each case of input you have to print the case number and expected answer.

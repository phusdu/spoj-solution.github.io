### **Statement**

Arithmancy is Draco Malfoy's favorite subject, but what spoils it for him is
that Hermione Granger is in his class, and she is better than him at it. Prime
numbers are of mystical importance in Arithmancy, and Lucky Numbers even more
so. Lucky Numbers are those positive integers that have at least three
distinct prime factors; 30 and 42 are the first two. Malfoy's teacher has
given them a positive integer n , and has asked them to find the n -th
lucky number. Malfoy would like to beat Hermione at this exercise, so although
he is an evil git, please help him, just this once. After all, the know-it-all
Hermione does need a lesson.

### Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T
lines contains one integer n.

### Output

Output T lines, containing the corresponding lucky number for that test
case.

### Constraints

1  <= T <= 20  
1 <= n <= 1000

### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug just got herself a new pet. She was thinking about a name for
it. She thought-up a beautiful name for it already but now she doesn't think
this name is "enough". She wants to find a new name, which will contain the
original name at least K times as substring (to emphasize its importance).
As ada doesn't want the pet's name to be too long, she wants to find the
shortest one - can you find the length of it?

### Input

The first line of input will contain T , the number of test-cases.

Each of the next T lines will contain a non-empty string s ,
consisting of lowercase-english letters and a number 1 ≤ K ≤
10<sup>6</sup> (the number of times the given name shall be in the new
name).

The sum of lengths of strings over all test-cases will not exceed
5*10<sup>5</sup>.

### Output

For each test-case print the minimum length of new name.

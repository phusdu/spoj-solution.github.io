### **Statement**

A job has been assigned to Jar Jar Binks, it goes as follows:

There are N spaceships parts, each with a weight of Wi kg. Given a weight W,
he has to show how many parts can be used in order to make a ship with a
weight of exactly W kg. He has to show all possible solutions, of course if
possible.

Everybody knows Jar Jar Binks particularly because of his clumsiness, so you
have to help him. Write a program that solves his problem!

  

### Input

There will be several cases, each beginning with two integers N, Q (1<=N<=60,
0<=Q<=10000).

Next there will be N positive integers representing the weights of the N
spaceship parts (1<=Wi<=1000).

Q lines will follow, each one with only one (not necessarily positive) integer
W, the total weight of the spaceship.

End of input will be denoted with N = 0 and Q = 0. This case should not be
processed

### Output

Print a line with K integers per query in ascending order. They must represent
the amount of pieces that can be used to make a spaceship with weight W.

If there is no way to make a spaceship with weight W, output a line with the
string “That's impossible!” (quotes to clarify)

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     5 4
    
    1 2 3 1 1
    
    3
    
    5 
    
    1
    
    9
    
    0 0
    
    Output:
    
    
     1 2 3
    
    2 3 4
    
    1
    
    That's impossible!
    
    
      
    
    
    
    
    
    Explanation of the query W = 5
    
    A spaceship with weight = 5 kg can be formed with 2, 3 and 4 parts, for example:  
    2 kg + 3 kg = 5 kg
    
    3 kg + 1 kg + 1 kg = 5 kg
    
    1 kg + 1 kg + 1 kg + 2 kg = 5 kg

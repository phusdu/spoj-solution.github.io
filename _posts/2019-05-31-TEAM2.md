### **Statement**

Mr. B, Mr. G, Mr. M and their coach Professor S are planning their way to
Warsaw for the ACM-ICPC World Finals. Each of the four has a square-shaped
suitcase with side length A<sub>i</sub> (1 <= _i_ <= 4) respectively. They
want to pack their suitcases into a large square box. The heights of the large
box as well as the four suitcases are exactly the same. So they only need to
consider the large boxâ€™s side length. Of course, you should write a program to
output the minimum side length of the large box so that the four suitcases can
be put into the box without overlapping.

### Input

Each test case contains only one line containing 4 integers A<sub>i</sub>
(1<= _i_ <=4, 1<= A<sub>i</sub> <=1,000,000,000) indicating the side
length of each suitcase.

### Output

For each test case, display a single line containing the case number and the
minimum side length of the large box required.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2 2 2 2
    2 2 2 1
    
    Output:
    Case 1: 4
    Case 2: 4
    

Explanation 

For the first case, all suitcases have size 2x2. So they can perfectly be
packed in a 4x4 large box without wasting any space.

For the second case, three suitcases have size 2x2 and the last one is 1x1. No
matter how to rotate or move, you could find the side length of the box must
be at least 4.

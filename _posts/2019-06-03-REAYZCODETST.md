### **Statement**

Great programmer “Tourist” is attending a coding test. In this test he is
asked to solve an easy problem. The problem description is,

_There is an array a consists of n integers and another nonnegative
integer x. He need to find the number of pair (i, j) where i!=j &
a<sub>i </sub>– a<sub>j</sub> = x. _

As it is very easy for him, he gave you this problem and start trying another
hard problem. Can you solve this for him?

### Input

Input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10), number of test case.

Each case contains two integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>), and x (0
≤ x ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).

Next line contains n separated integers a<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤
a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).

### Output

For each case, print the case number and the number of pairs which meet the
above condition.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     2
    
    5 3
    
    5 1 4 2 3
    
    10 2
    
    12 17 19 13 17 11 17 12 15 14
    
    Output:
    
    
     Case 1: 2
    
    Case 2: 10

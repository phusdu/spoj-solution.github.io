code: ZQUERY

### **Statement**

[English](/problems/ZQUERY/en) | [Vietnamese](/problems/ZQUERY/vn)  
---|---  
  
Given an array having N elements, each element is either -1 or 1.

You have M queries, each query has two numbers L and R , you have
to answer the length of the longest subarray in range L to R
(inclusive) that its sum is equal to 0.

### Input

The first line contains two numbers N and M ( 1 <= N , M
<= 50000 ) - the number of elements and the number of queries.

The second line contains N numbers - the elements of the array, each
element is either -1 or 1.

In the next M lines, each line contains two numbers L and R (
1 <= L <= R <= N ).

### Output

For each query, print the length of the longest subarray that satisfies the
query in one line. If there isn't any such subarray, print 0.

### Note

Subarray in an array is like substring in a string, i.e. subarray should
contain contiguous elements.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    6 4
    1 1 1 -1 -1 -1
    1 3
    1 4
    1 5
    1 6
    
    
    Output:
    0
    2
    4
    6

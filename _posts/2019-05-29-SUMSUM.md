### **Statement**

You are given N numbers of the array (N <= 100000), all less than 10^8 and
greater than 0.

Now, you are given 2 queries:

  1. `"1 x i"` : Change the i-th number to x. (0 <= x <= 10^8)
  2. `"2 Op i1 i2"`: Compute the sum of all two elements taken at a time within index i1 to i2(both inclusive) under the operation Op. Op could be XOR,OR or AND.

For example, let N=4, Query=3 and `"10 20 30 40"` be the Initial array.

Query:

    
    
    2 OR 1 3
    1 0 1
    2 OR 1 3
    

Answer:

    
    
    2 OR 1 3--> (10 OR 20) + (20 OR 30) + (10 OR 30)
    1 0 1   --> Now array becomes 0 20 30 40
    2 OR 1 3--> (0 OR 20) + (20 OR 30) + (0 OR 30)

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4 3
    10 20 30 40
    2 OR 1 3
    1 0 1
    2 OR 1 3
    
    Output
    90
    80

NOTE: If i1 is equal to i2, always output 0.

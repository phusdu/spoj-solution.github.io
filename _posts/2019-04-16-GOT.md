### **Statement**

There's a tree, with each vertex assigned a number. For each query (a, b, c),
you are asked whether there is a vertex on the path from a to b, which is
assigned number c?

### Input

There are multiple cases, end by EOF.

For each case, the first line contains n (n <= 100000) and m (m <= 200000),
representing the number of vertexes (numbered from 1 to n) and the number of
queries.

Then n integers follows, representing the number assigned to the i-th vertex.

Then n-1 lines, each of which contains a edge of the tree.

Then m lines, each of which contains three integers a, b and c (0 <= c <= n),
representing a query.

### Output

You should output "`Find`" or "`NotFind`" for every query on one line.

Output a blank line AFTER every case.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    5 5
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 2
    1 3
    3 4
    3 5
    2 3 4
    2 4 3
    2 4 5
    4 5 1
    4 5 3
    
    Output:
    NotFind
    Find
    NotFind
    NotFind
    Find

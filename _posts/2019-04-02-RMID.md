code: RMID

### **Statement**

You will be given some integers in non decreasing order and each time the
median is queried you have to report and remove it. Take the smaller element
as median in case of even elements.

### Input

The input contains many test cases. Read until End Of File.

Each test case contains n (n â‰¤ 100000) positive integers in non-decreasing
order, along with m queries indicated by -1, all on separate lines. (See the
example.)

For a query, print the current median on a single line and remove it from the
list.

Each test case ends with 0 on a single line, and two test cases will be
separated by an empty line. All integers are guaranteed to fit in a signed
32-bit container. A query can only occur if the list is non-empty.

### Output

For each test case output m lines containing the answers to the corresponding
queries. Print an empty line after each test case.

### Example

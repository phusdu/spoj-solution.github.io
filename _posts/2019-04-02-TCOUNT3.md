### **Statement**

Have you felt bored when counting triangles?

Like TRICOUNT and TCOUNT2, we define the LEVEL of a triangle as in the
following illustrative image:

And now we will continue defining the LEVEL of a hexagram. It's called level N
hexagram if itâ€™s joined by 12 triangles, each one is a level N triangle.

Task: All you have to do is to count all triangles in the level N
hexagram.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases
and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N which is the level of the
hexagram in that test case.

### Output

For each test case, you should write a seperate line: the number of triangles
in the level N hexagram. (All answers will fit within the range of a 64-bit
positive integer)

### Example

    
    
    Input:

### **Statement**

Zen has a Crush and is always fantasizing about her. He is so restless now,
that he has decided to meet her and express his immense feelings about her. He
fears a lot of being rejected that's why he wants to examine his luck. Zen has
N biased coins where the probability of getting Head from _i th _
coin is P i. His luck of being accepted is the probability of getting
exactly K heads when N coins are tossed simultaneously.  
  
Zen is weak in programming and asking for help. Can you help him to calculate
his luck?

### Input

First Line of the input file contains, T -number of test cases. (1
<=T<=100)  
Each test case followed by two integers, N and K. (1 <=N<=1000 &&
0<=K<=N)  
Next line contains N -space separated real values, P i.

### Output

For each test case, you have to print desired output(up to 10 decimal
places).

### Example

    
    
    Input:
     1  
    3 2  
    0.0 0.5 1.0
    
    Output:

### **Statement**

Ted thinks that integers having equal number of 1's and 0's in their binary
representation are special. Therefore, he wants to know how many such integers
are present.

Note: For this problem, the binary representation of an integer( >0) is
considered from the least significant bit to the last set bit. Which means, 5
has a binary representation of 101, 3 has a binary representation of 11 etc.
As such, one example of a special number is 9 which has a binary
representation, 1001.

### Input

First line contains an integer T(atmost 100) denoting the total number of test
cases. Each test case contains a single integer N(2 <= N <= 2^60). N is always
a power of 2.

### Output

A single integer denoting the total number of such special numbers in the
range 1 to N (inclusive).

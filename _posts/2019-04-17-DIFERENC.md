### **Statement**

Mirko discovered what Slavko did in previous task, and decided to deal with
something completely

opposite to tables of letters: sequences of numbers.

Let’s define a value of a sequence as the difference between the largest and
the smallest number within

that sequence. For example, value of sequence (3, 1, 7, 2) is 6, and value of
(42, 42) is 0.

Find the sum of values of all subsequences of consecutive elements of a given
sequence.

INPUT

The first line of input contains a single integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 300 000), number
of elements of the

sequence.

Next N lines contain elements of the sequence. Each element is a positive
integer not greater than 100

000 000.

OUTPUT

The first and only line of output must contain the requested sum.

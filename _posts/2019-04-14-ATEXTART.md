### **Statement**

_"ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation
and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total
of 128) characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant
character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters
of standard 7-bit ASCII). The term is also loosely used to refer to text based
visual art in general. ASCII art can be created with any text editor, and is
often used with free-form languages."_ \- Wikepedia

For example, here is an ASCII Text Art:

    
    
      |\_/|            (\_/)
     / @ @ \       *  "Purrrfectly pleasant"  *   (='.'=)
    ( > º < )      *       Poppy Prinz        *   (")_(")
     `>>x<<´       *   (pprinz@example.com)   *
     /  O  \       
    

In this problem, you have to write a program, which will output an ASCII Text
Art like the following image:

Note: Whitespaces are replaced with . (dot) for better conception, this will
not be in output.

### Input

Input will consist of only one printable ASCII character.

Constraints:

Pintables of 128 bit ASCII characters

### Output

Your program should use the character to print the desired output.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    #
    
    Output:
    
    
    
     # # # # # # # # # # #         # # # # # # # # # # #
                #    #     ##                    #    #
              # # #  #   #    #                  # #  #
            #   #  # #  #      #                 #  # #
          #     #    #   ######                  #    #
        #       #    #  #                        #    #
          #     #    #    #            #     #   #    #
            #   #    #      #        #  #  #  #  #    #
              # #    #        #     #     #    # #    #
                #    #          #  #             #    #

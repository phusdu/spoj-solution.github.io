### **Statement**

SPIRAL RUN

  


![](http://www.spoj.com/content/cegprakash:spiralrun.jpg)

The run starts from the center point. At each step you have to move in the
spiral path as shown in the figure. At each step you can move exactly 1
unit(say 1cm). The path of the run should not overlap. Find the direction of
the next move after n moves.

Input Specification:

The first line consists of an integer t, denoting the number of test cases.
For the next t lines, each line consists of an integer n, the number of moves
already made.

Output Specification:

For each test case find the direction of the next move after n moves.

Note: The first letter alone must be capitalized

Input Constraints:

1<=t<=100

0<=n<=50000000

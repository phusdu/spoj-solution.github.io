### **Statement**

Lucky is fond of Number theory, one day he was solving a problem related to
Euler Totient Function (phi) and found an interesting property of phi : phi(1)
= 1, and for x > 1: phi(x) < x. So if we define a sequence with
a<sub>0</sub> = x, and for n > 0: a<sub>n</sub> =
phi(a<sub>n-1</sub>), this sequence will be constant equal to 1 starting
from some point. Lets define depth(x) as minimal n such that a<sub>n</sub>
= 1.  
Now he is wondering how many numbers in a given range have depth equal to
given number k. As you are a good programmer help Lucky with his task.

### Input

Your input will consist of a single integer T followed by a newline and
T test cases. Each test cases consists of a single line containing
integers m , n , and k.

### Output

Output for each test case one line containing the count of all numbers whose
depth equals to k in given range [ m , n ].

### Constraints

    
    
    T < 10001
    1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10^6
    0 ≤ k < 20
    

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    5
    1 3 1
    1 10 2
    1 10 3
    1 100 3
    1 1000000 17
    
    Output:
    1
    3
    5
    8
    287876

Explanation ::suppose number is 5 ; its depth will be 3. ( 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 )

Note ::Depth for 1 is 0.

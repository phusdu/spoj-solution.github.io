### **Statement**

Minas had a box of marble which is lost last week. About that box Minas only
know that length and height of the box was L and H , and box contains
K marbles. But he forget the width of the box. But he remember that
width = 2 * radius of marble and width is also an integer. You can assume
that all marble are same.

Now, Minas will give you L, H and K. You need to tell him the width of
the box. If the width is less than 1 then print -1.

### Input

Input starts with an integer T (1 <=T<=1000), denoting the number of test
cases.  
Each case contains 3 integer L (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) , H (1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9) and
K (1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9).

### Output

For each case of input, print the case number as "Case #: x" , # is
replaced by the case number starting from 1 and x is replaced by the
maximum possible width of the box.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    2 2 4
    
    Output:
    Case 1: 1

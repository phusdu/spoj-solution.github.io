### **Statement**

Consider two integer sequences f(n) = n! and g(n) = a<sup>n</sup>
, where n is a positive integer. For any integer a > 1 the second
sequence is greater than the first for a finite number of values. But starting
from some integer k , f(n) is greater than g(n) for all n >=
k. You are to find the least positive value of n for which f(n) >
g(n), for a given positive integer a > 1.

### Input

The first line of the input contains number t â€“ the amount of tests. Then
t test descriptions follow. Each test consist of a single number a.

### Constraints

1 <= t <= 100000  
2 <= a <= 10<sup>6</sup>

### Output

For each test print the least positive value of n for which f(n) >
g(n).

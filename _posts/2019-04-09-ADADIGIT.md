### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug likes numbers. Her friends know it so they wanted to give her
a number as a gift. Sadly, they bought the number in IKEA so Ada has to
assemble the number by herself. Now she is in following situation - she has a
few digits before herself and she is wondering what number she will create. As
she doesn't understand the manual (it is in Swedish) she has possibility to
assemble anything.

She is not sure yet, anyway her favourite options are to assemble number with
the most divisors or the number with the biggest sum of divisors. Can you help
her to find such?

NOTE: To assemble number from digits, simply choose any permutation of
digits. Leading zeroes are perfectly OK but you have to use all the
digits.

### Input

The first line of each test-case will contain an integer 1 ≤ N ≤ 9 , the
number of digits to assemble.

The next line will contain N digits 0 ≤ d<sub>i</sub> ≤ 9.

### Output

Output two integers - the number with the most divisors AND the number with
biggest sum of divisors. In case there are multiple such numbers, choose the
lesser one. As long as you would use leading zeroes, output the number without
the leading zeroes.

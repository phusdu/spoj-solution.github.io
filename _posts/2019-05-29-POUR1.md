### **Statement**

Given two vessels, one of which can accommodate _a_ litres of water and the
other - _b_ litres of water, determine the number of steps required to obtain
exactly _c_ litres of water in one of the vessels.

At the beginning both vessels are empty. The following operations are counted
as 'steps':

  * emptying a vessel, 
  * filling a vessel, 
  * pouring water from one vessel to the other, without spilling, until one of the vessels is either full or empty. 

### Input

An integer _t_ , 1<= _t_ <=100, denoting the number of testcases, followed by
_t_ sets of input data, each consisting of three positive integers _a, b, c_ ,
not larger than 40000, given in separate lines.

### Output

For each set of input data, output the minimum number of steps required to
obtain c litres, or -1 if this is impossible.

### Example

Sample input:

    
    
    2
    5
    2
    3
    2
    3
    4
    

Sample output:

    
    
    2
    -1

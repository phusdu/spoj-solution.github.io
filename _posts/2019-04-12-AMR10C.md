### **Statement**

You all know about factorization of an integer. Here we want you to factor a
number into as few factors as possible. That is easy, you say, just have the
number itself, and that will be the smallest number of factors i.e. 1.  
But wait, I haven't finished -- each of the factors that you find must be
square-free. A square-free number, however you factor it, won't have any
factor that is a perfect square. Of course, you can never include 1 as a
factor.

### Input

The first line of input is the number of test cases T.  
The next T lines each have an integer N.

### Output

For each testcase, output the smallest number of square-free factors.

### Constraints

T <= 10<sup>4</sup>  
2 <= N <= 10<sup>6</sup>

title:  BHADRADAWOW - Bhadra Da and Counting "wow"
categories: ['uncategorized']
code: BHADRADAWOW
src: BHADRADAWOW.cpp

### **Statement**

I think all of us are familiar with word ‘wow’…. Simply, when you find an easy
problem ( like this ) in contest firstly you say “wow”, then starts coding.

Nowdays, Our famous “Bhadra Dada” is busy with codechef long challenge
contest. So, He do not have time to set problem for a practice conest of his
Jahangirnagar university. But he said that he want to see ranklist to see the
progress of students. Since, he is not setter of any problem of practice
contest, he don’t have permission to see ranklist. So, I make a plan of giving
him a encoded string , he can decode it by finding numbers of “wow” that can
be made by picking up different characters from encoded string, which is
equal to the number of solves of particular student. ( Note: while picing up
letters you can change the case of letters )

As I had already said, he is busy with codechef long challenge contest , your
task is to help him by finding the answer of this task.

### Input

First line begins with N giving number of student participating in
contest. For student first line begins with L , giving the length of
encoded string then next line containing encoded string.

Constraints:

1 <=N<=100

1 <= L <=100

String will contain only upper and lowercase letters.

### Output

For each student of input, print one line of output denoting the decoded
number of solves by that student.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     2
    
    
    6
    
    
    wWoowW
    
    
    3
    
    
    wwW
    
     Output:
    
    
     2
    0

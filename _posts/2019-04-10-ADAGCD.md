### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug got interesting homework. She had to count gcd of a few
numbers. As she is a great mathematician, she done it in meanwhile (in fact,
she submited it during the class it was assigned in). The teacher was
impressed so he gave Ada a bonus homework (for bonus points). It is same as
previous one with a little difference - there are bigger numbers.

Since the number are too large to be written as numbers, they are written as
product of lesser numbers. Find their gcd.

### Input

The first line of input consists of 2 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> , the
number of numbers for which Ada wants to find their gcd.

Each of the next N lines contains an integer 1 ≤ M<sub>i</sub> <
10<sup>6</sup> followed by M<sub>i</sub> integers, 1 ≤
A<sub>j</sub> ≤ 10<sup>7</sup> , the numbers whose product is the
i<sup>th</sup> number.

The sum of all M<sub>i</sub> won't exceed 10<sup>6</sup>

### Output

Print the gcd on a single line. Since this number might be pretty big,
output it modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7 ( 1000000007 )

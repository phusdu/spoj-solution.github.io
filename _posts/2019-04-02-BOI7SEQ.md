### **Statement**

We are given a sequence a1 , ..., an . We can manipulate this sequence using
the operation reduce(i), which replaces elements ai and ai+1 with a single
element max(ai , ai+1 ), resulting in a new shorter sequence. The cost of this
operation is max(ai , ai+1 ). After n−1 operations reduce, we obtain a
sequence of length 1. Our task is to compute the cost of the optimal reducing
scheme, i.e. the sequence of reduce operations with minimal cost leading to a
sequence of length 1.

### Input

The first line contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000), the length of the sequence. The
following n lines contain one integer ai , the elements of the sequence (0 ≤
ai ≤ 1,000,000,000).

### Output

In the first and only line of the output print the minimal cost of reducing
the sequence to a single element.

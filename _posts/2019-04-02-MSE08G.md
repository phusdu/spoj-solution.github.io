### **Statement**

---|---  
  
John has recently arrived in Bucharest for the South Eastern European Regional
Contest. John is famous for his theory of lucky numbers. That’s why all the
contestants and spectators are very happy. According to that theory 4 and 7
are lucky digits, and all the other digits are not lucky. A lucky number is a
number that contains only lucky digits in decimal notation. A very lucky
number is a number that can be expressed as a product of several lucky
numbers. A lucky number by itself is considered to be very lucky. For example,
numbers 47, 49, 112 are very lucky.

Your task is to calculate the number of very lucky numbers that are not less
than A and not greater than B. Of course, numbers A and B are given by John.

### Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T – a number of test
cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers separated by a single
space – A and B.

### Output

Output must contain T lines – answers for the test cases. Constrains:

1 ≤ T ≤ 7777,

1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1000000000000 (10^12).

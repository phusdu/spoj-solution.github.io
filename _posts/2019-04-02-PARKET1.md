### **Statement**

Ivica has set up a new parquet flooring in his room. The room is L decimeters
long and W decimeters wide.

The blocks are of quadratic shape and each has an area of one quadratic
decimeter. Once Ivica had set up the flooring, which consists of brown.colored
blocks, he decided to paint the blocks on the edge of the room red.

The picture below illustrates the scenario from the test case #2 – outer
blocks are red, while the remaining two inner blocks are brown:

Marica has come to visit Ivica. While Ivica was serving her cookies, she
counted the number of blocks of each color. When she returned home, she
recalled of the two numbers and wished to calculate the dimensions of Ivica’s
room. Help her!

### Input

The first and only line of input contains two integers separated by a space, R
(the number of red blocks) and B (the number of brown blocks). The following
constraints will apply: 8 ≤ R ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ B ≤ 2*10<sup>6</sup>.

### Output

The first and only line of output must contain the dimensions of the room, L
and W, respectively. If the numbers differ, output the greater one first. The
test data will ensure that a unique solution always exists.

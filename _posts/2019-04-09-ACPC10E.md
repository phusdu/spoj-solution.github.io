### **Statement**

FIFA is considering a few changes to the way it organizes the Football World
Cup. Currently, 32 teams compete for the World Title in two stages. During the
first stage, known as the groups stage, the 32 teams are split evenly into 8
groups. Every team in the group plays 3 games, one against each team in their
own group. Teams are then ranked within their group according to some points
system. During the second (and final) stage, the top two teams from each group
advance to the knockout stage where eight games are played to determine eight
winners who would then play four games to determine four winners, then two
games to determine the two winners who would then play the final game to
determine the world champion. Needless to say, for the knockout stage to work,
the number of teams in that stage has to be a power of two. FIFA is
considering adding more groups, adding more teams to groups, and possibly
changing the number of teams advancing from each group to the knockout stage.
In addition, FIFA is considering having certain teams (previous champion, host
country, etc.) advance to the knockout stage directly (without having to play
in the groups stage.) But FIFA needs to know how many games will be played if
any of these changes are applied. Please help them!

### Input

Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. Each test case is
specified on a single line made of 4 natural numbers with the following
format:  
G T A D  
Where (G > 0) is the number of groups; T is the number of teams in each group;
A is the number of teams advancing from each group to the knockout stage; and
D is the number of teams directly advancing to the knockout stage without
going through the groups stage. Note that (0 < A ≤ T) and that the four
numbers in the input are no larger than 2<sup>16</sup>.  
If the total number of teams in the knockout stage is not a power of two, your
program must increase them to the closest power of two.  
The last test case is followed by a dummy line made of four -1’s.

### Output

For each test case, print:  
G*A/T+D=X+Y  
where G, A, T, and D are as in the input, X is the total number of games, and
Y is the number of teams your program determined it must add.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     8 4 2 0  
    8 4 2 1  
    -1 -1 -1 -1  
      
     Output:  
     8*2/4+0=63+0  
    8*2/4+1=79+15

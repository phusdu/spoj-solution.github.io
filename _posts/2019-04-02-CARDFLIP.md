### **Statement**

Dolan has a stack of card. Each card is numbered from 1 to n from top to
bottom. His nephews want to play with the cards. Each nephew can only do one
kind of operation.

Nephew number 1 will reverse the order of the card from i-th to j-th position.

Nephew number 2 will ask uncle Dolan what is the card number on i-th position.

Nephew number 3 will ask uncle Dolan in what position is the card number i.

Since Dolan is a good uncle, he will have to answer all questions correctly.
Please help Dolan.

### Input

First line on input is n and q, the number of cards (n < 100000) and number of
operations by the nephews (q < 100000). The next q lines will contain the
operation by the nephews.

For each operation, the first number will be the nephew number. The second
(and possibly third) number is i (and j) from the description above (1 < i < j
< n).

### Output

For each question asked by the nephews (operation 2 and 3), output a single
line containing the answer.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    10 5  
     1 2 6  
    2 5  
    1 4 9  
    3 4  
    2 4 
    
    
    Output:
    3  
     9

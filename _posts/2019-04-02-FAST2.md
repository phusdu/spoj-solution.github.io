### **Statement**

There is people that really like to do silly thinks, one of them is sum the
numbers from 2^0 to 2^n, task is actually really simple, just do a ultra fast
sum of term 2^0 to 2^n

### Input

the first line starts with a number, T, wich is the number of test cases, T
lines will follow

each line contains a number "n" that is the nth term of the sum from 2^0 to
2^n

0<=n<=500

### Output

Output the sum from 2^0 to 2^n MODULO 1298074214633706835075030044377087

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3  
     0  
    1  
    2  
      
     Output:
    1  
     3  
    7   
      
    Extra: TLE is equal to 0.15s  
    



#### **Solution**

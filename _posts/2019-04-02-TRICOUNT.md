### **Statement**

We define the LEVEL of a triangle as in the following illustrative image:  
![](../../../content/duonghanguyen:tricount.png)  
Task: Your task is very easy. All you have to do is to count all triangles
in the biggest one (Level N).

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T (T ≤ 10000) - the number of
test cases and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤
10<sup>6</sup>) which is the level of the triangle in that test case.

### Output

For each test case, you should write a seperate line: the number of triangles
in the biggest one (Level N). (All answers will fit within the range of a
64-bit integer)

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     3  
    1  
    2  
    3  
      
     Output:  
     1  
    5  
    13

### **Statement**

There is a SmileyLand of angels. The queen of all angels Smiley1807 loves the
number 1807. She is so much obsessed with 1807 that she asked her programmer
friend to write a program to find the length of the largest sub sequence
having digits 1,8,0 and 7 in order. For example if given sequence is
1800777700088888000777 then one of the largest sub sequence satisfying the
above condition is 1800000000777 (there is one more possibility of
1888888000777)and hence the length of largest sub sequence is 13.

### Input

The input contains only one test case.

The test case consist of only one sequence which may be as long as 10^6. There
are only 1,8,0 or 7 present in the input sequence.

### Output

Output contains only one line containing the length of the largest sub-
sequence.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1800777700088888000777
    
    Output:
    13  
    
    
    
    Explanation
    
     1800000000777 is the largest sub-sequence
    
      
     Note  
      
     Only C, C++, C#, Haskell, Java, Lisp, Python and Scala are allowed!

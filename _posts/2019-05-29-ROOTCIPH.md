### **Statement**

Radar scanned the approaching enemy aircraft on the border. However due to
some error part of the tranmitted data can't be deciphered. It was possible
only to obtain the coefficients of the cubic polynomial, whose roots are the
coordinates of the aircraft relative to the radar. Now you need to calculate
the distance to the aircraft. Write the program to solve this task.

### Input

The first line contains T (1 <= T <= 1000) - number tests. The next T lines
contain three integers a, b and c - coefficients of the polynomial _x_
<sup>3</sup> + _ax_ <sup>2</sup> + _bx_ \+ _c_ , whose roots are the
coordinates (the absolute value of the coordinates do not exceed
10<sup>8</sup>).

### Output

For each test print the square of the distance to the enemy aircraft.

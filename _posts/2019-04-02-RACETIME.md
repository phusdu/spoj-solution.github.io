### **Statement**

As another one of their crazy antics, the N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) cows want Farmer
John to race against the clock to answer some of their pressing questions.

The cows are lined up in a row from 1 to N, and each one is holding a sign
representing a number, A<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤
1,000,000,000). The cows need FJ to perform Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 50,000) operations,
which can be either of the following:

  * Modify cow i's number to X (1 ≤ X ≤ 1,000,000,000). This will be represented in the input as a line containing the letter M followed by the space-separated numbers i and X.
  * Count how many cows in the range [P, Q] (1 ≤ P ≤ Q ≤ N) have A<sub>i</sub> ≤ X (0 ≤ X ≤ 1,000,000,000). This will be represented in the input as a line containing the letter C followed by the space-separated numbers P, Q, and X.

Of course, FJ would like your help.

### Input

The first line gives the integers N and Q, and the next N lines give the
initial values of A<sub>i</sub>. Finally, the next Q lines each contain a
query of the form "M i X" or "C P Q X".

### Output

Print the answer to each 'C' query, one per line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4 6
    3
    4
    1
    7
    C 2 4 4
    M 4 1
    C 2 4 4
    C 1 4 5
    M 2 10
    C 1 3 9
    
    Output:
    2
    3
    4
    2
    

FJ has 4 cows, whose initial numbers are 3, 4, 1, and 7. The cows then give
him 6 operations; the first asks him to count the how many of the last three
cows have a number at most 4, the second asks him to change the fourth cow's
number to 1, etc.

### **Statement**

Correct Bracket Sequence (CBS) is a sequence that can be obtained through
following rules:  
1) An empty string is the CBS.  
2) If A is a CBS, then B = (A) is also a CBS.  
3) If A is a CBS, then B = [A] is also a CBS.  
4) If A and B are CBS, then C = AB is also a CBS.  
Length of the CBS is the number of brackets in it, and this number is always
even.  
Assume that '(' < ')' < '[' < ']'.  
CBS a1a2 ... an is lexicografically smaller than the CBS b1b2 ... bn if and
only if there exists an integer i, i <= n, so that aj=bj, for each j, 1 <= j <
i and ai < bi.

### Illustration

Enumerate all CBS length 4 in lexicographical order: (()), ()(), ()[], ([]),
[()], [[]], [](), [][].

### Task

Your task is to find k-th CBS with length n in lexicographical order

### Input

Contains 2 integers n (2..250) and k (1..10^120)

### Output

Print the k-th CBS with length n in lexicographical order

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4
    3
    Output:
    ()[]

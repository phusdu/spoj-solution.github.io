### **Statement**

Given three integers a, b, k. Find the count of numbers in interval [a, b],
which have exactly k bits with value 1, in their binary representation.

### Input

Three numbers - a, b, k.

    
    
    0 <= a <= b <= 10^8, 0 <= k <= 30

### Output

Required count.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    35 1000 3
    
    Output:
    110

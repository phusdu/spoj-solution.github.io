### **Statement**

Buying Integers



Let's assume that you have n integers, A<sub>1,</sub>
A<sub>2,</sub> A<sub>3</sub> … A<sub>n </sub>

Let's define,

E = Number of pairs (i,j) such that i <j and ( A<sub>i
</sub>+<sub> </sub>A<sub>j </sub>) are even . 

O = Number of pairs (i,j) such that i <j and ( A<sub>i
</sub>+<sub> </sub>A<sub>j </sub>) are odd . 

D = | E-O |



That means, D = (E-O) if (E-O) ≥ 0 , -(E-O) otherwise .

Unfortunately, you do have n but those n integers are lost . You will
have to buy them again. Before going to the market, you have decided that you
will buy n integers in such a way that the value of D will be as small
as possible, as you will have to pay D golden coins, to buy them.

Now,you are wondering, what that minimum D [ Let's say it
D<sub>min</sub>] will  be .

Input



First line of the input file will contain the number of test cases, T ≤
1000000 , followed by T lines, each containing an integer n (
1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).

Output



For each case, print the case number starting from 1 and D<sub>min
</sub> for the value of n in that particular case. See the sample
output for exact formatting.

Warning : Input file is huge, please use faster input and output methods
(e.g. printf and scanf in C++) .

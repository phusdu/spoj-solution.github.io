### **Statement**

A N×N matrix is filled with numbers 1 to N<sup>2</sup>, diagonally in a
zig-zag fashion.

The table below shows numbers in the matrix for N = 6.

There is a rabbit in the cell containing number 1. A rabbit can jump to a
neighboring cell (up, down, left or right) if that cell exists.

Given K valid rabbit jumps, write a program that will calculate the sum of
numbers of all cells that rabbit visited (add the number to the sum each time
rabbit visits the same cell).

### Input

The first line contains two integers N and K (1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 300
000), the size of the matrix and the number of rabbit jumps.

The second line contains a sequence of K characters 'U', 'D', 'L' and 'R',
describing the direction of each jump. The sequence of jumps will not leave
the matrix at any moment.

### Output

Output one integer, the sum of numbers on visited cells.

Note: This number doesn't always fit in 32-bit integer type.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    6 8
    DDRRUULL
    
    Output:

Clarification for the first sample: The rabbit visits cells 1, 3, 4, 9,
13, 8, 6, 2 and 1. Clarification for the second sample: The rabbit visits
cells 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 7, 6, 2 and 1. Clarification for the third sample:
The rabbit visits cells 1, 2, 6, 7, 15, 16, 26, 27, 33, 34 and 36.

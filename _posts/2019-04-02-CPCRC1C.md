### **Statement**

Majid is a 3rd-grade elementary student and quite well in mathematics. Once,
Majid's teacher asked him to calculate the sum of numbers 1 through n.

Majid quickly answered, and his teacher made him another challenge. He asked
Majid to calculate the sum of the digits of numbers 1 through n.

Majid did finally find the solution. Now it is your turn, can you find a
solution?

### Input

Two space-separated integers 0 <= a <= b <= 10<sup>9</sup>.

Program terminates if a and b are -1.

### Output

The sum of the digits of numbers a through b.

### Example

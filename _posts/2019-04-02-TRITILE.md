### **Statement**

Problem Statement  
Var is trying to find a new geometric shape with an even number of sides. She
starts with an equilateral triangle and performs a series of n steps. At each
step she adds an equilateral triangle to the outer sides of the shape she
already has. Can you tell, if after n steps, her new shape will have even
number of sides or not?  
  
Input  
First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test
case contains an integer n, denoting the total number of steps she performs.  
  
Output  
Print “Yes” if she ends up with a shape that has even number of sides, or
print “No”.  
  
Constraints  
1  <= T <= 100  
1 <= n <= 10 ^ 18  
  
Sample Input  
1

Sample Output  
No

As you can, see the number of edges is 3, which is odd.

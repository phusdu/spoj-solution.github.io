One day, he wants to go from city A to city B. Between A and B, there are N
number of cities(including B and excluding A) and in each city there are M
buses numbered from 1 to M. And the fare of each bus is different. Means for
all N*M busses, fare (K) may be different or same. Now Jack has to go from
city A to city B following these conditions:

  1. At every city, he has to change the bus.
  2. And he can switch to only those buses which have number either equal or 1 less or 1 greater to the previous.

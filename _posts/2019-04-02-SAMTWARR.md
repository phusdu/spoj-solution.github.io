### **Statement**

You are given two arrays each of length N(1 <= N <= 100000) which are
initially filled with zeros. You have to apply M (1 <= M <= 100000) queries of
three kind:

0 arr left right : calculate and output sum of elements from left to right
in array arr (arr = 0 -- first array, arr = 1 -- second array);  
1 arr idx newValue : change value of element at index idx of array arr on
newValue;  
 2 left right : swap range of elements of two arrays from left to right (
for i = left to right do swap(a[i], b[i]) );

### Input

The first line of input contains two integers - N, M. The folowing M lines
contains information about queries.  
On each query - one line:  
First integer number cmd contains 0, 1 or 2 (type of query described above).  
if cmd equals 0 , then following 3 integers arr, left, right - 0 <= arr <=
1, 0 <= left <= right <= N - 1.  
if cmd equals 1 , then following 3 integers arr, idx, newValue - 0 <= arr
<= 1, 0 <= idx <= N - 1, -10000 <= newValue <= 10000.  
if cmd equals 2 , then following 2 integers left, right - 0 <= left <=
right <= N - 1.

### Output

On each query with cmd equals 0 you should output corresponding value
described above.

### Example

Input:  
5 10  
1 0 0 1  
1 1 4 2  
0 0 0 4  
0 1 0 4  
2 0 0  
0 0 0 4  
0 1 0 4  
2 0 4  
0 0 0 4  
0 1 0 4  
  
 Output:  
1  
2  
0  
3  
3  
0

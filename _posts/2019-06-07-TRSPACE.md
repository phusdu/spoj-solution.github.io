### **Statement**

In some filesystems, the disk space used by a file is not always equal to the
file's size. This is because the disk is divided into clusters of equal size,
and each cluster can only be used by a single file. For example, if the
cluster size is 512 bytes, and we have a file of size 600 bytes, it would have
to be stored in two clusters. Those two clusters cannot be shared with any
other files, so the file ends up using 1024 bytes of disk space.

Note that we don't need any clusters for a file of size 0.

Given N single files and the cluster size, you have to print the total
disk space used by the given files.

### Input

The first line of input will contain T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N , denoting the
number of files and S , denoting the cluster size of the file system. The
second line of each test case contains N integers a<sub>i</sub> (1
<= i <= N) denoting the size of the ith file.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 1000  
1 <= N <= 100  
1 <= S <= 1048576  
0 <= a<sub>i</sub> <= 10^9

### Output

For each test case print a single line containing “Case X: S” without the
quotes, where X is the case number and S is the total disk space used
by the given files.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    1 512
    600
    4 32768
    16 32 128 128
    
    Output:
    Case 1: 1024
    Case 2: 131072

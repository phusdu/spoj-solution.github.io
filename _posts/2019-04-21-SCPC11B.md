The Alaska Highway runs 1422 miles from Dawson Creek, British Columbia to
Delta Junction, Alaska.

Brenda would like to be the first person to drive her new electric car the
length of the highway. Her car can travel up to 200 miles once charged at a
special charging station. There is a charging station in Dawson Creek, where
she begins her journey, and also several charging stations along the way. Can
Brenda drive her car from Dawson City to Delta Juntion and back?

### Input

The input contains several scenario. Each scenario begins with a line
containing n, a positive number indicating the number of charging stations. n
lines follow, each giving the location of a filling station on the highway,
including the one in Dawson City. The location is an integer between 0 and
1422, inclusive, indicating the distance in miles from Dawson Creek. No two
filling stations are at the same location. A line containing 0 follows the
last scenario.

### Output

For each scenario, output a line containing `POSSIBLE` if Brenda can make the
trip.

Otherwise, output a line containing the word `IMPOSSIBLE`.

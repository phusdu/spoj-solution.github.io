### **Statement**

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or other sequence of units that has the
property of reading the same in either direction, e.g. 'racecar', 'solos'.

### Task

You are given a number k (2≤k≤30000) and a non-empty string S whose length
does not exceed 30000 lowercase letters.  
We say two palindromes are different when they start from different positions.
How many different palindromes of the length k does S contains?

### Input

The first line contains K. The second line contains S. K does not exceed the
length of S.

### Output

The first and only line should consist of a single number - the number of
palindromes found.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    5
    ababab
    Output:
    2

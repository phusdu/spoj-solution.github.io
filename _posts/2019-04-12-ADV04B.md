### **Statement**

There is a king in the lower left corner of the n × n checkmate board. The
king can move one step right, one step up or one step up-right. How many ways
are there for him to reach the upper right corner of the board?

### Input

The first line of input contains number T - the amount of test cases. Next T
lines consist of single integer n - the size of the board.

### Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000  
1 <= n <= 1000

### Output

For each test case output the munber of ways to reach upper right corner of n
× n board modulo 1000003.

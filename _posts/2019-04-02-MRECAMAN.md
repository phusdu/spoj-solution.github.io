### **Statement**

[English](/problems/MRECAMAN/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/MRECAMAN/vn/)  
---|---  
  
The Recaman’s sequence is deﬁned by a0 = 0 ; for m > 0, a(m) = a(m−1) − m if
the resulting a(m) is positive and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(m)
= a(m−1) + m. The ﬁrst few numbers in the Recaman’s Sequence is 0, 1, 3, 6, 2,
7, 13, 20, 12, 21, 11, 22, 10, 23, 9 · · · .

Given k, your task is to calculate a(k).

### Input

The input consists of several test cases. Each line of the input contains an
integer k where 0 ≤ k ≤ 500000. The last line contains an integer −1, which
should not be processed.

    
    
    Sample Input
    7
    10000
    -1

### Output

For each k given in the input, print one line containing a(k) to the output.

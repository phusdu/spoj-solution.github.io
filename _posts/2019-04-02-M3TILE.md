---|---  
      
    
    In how many ways can you tile a 3xn rectangle with 2x1 dominoes?
    
    Here is a sample tiling of a 3x12 rectangle.
    
    Input consists of several test cases followed by a line containing -1.
    Each test case is a line containing an integer 0 ≤ n ≤ 30. For each test
    case, output one integer number giving the number of possible tilings.

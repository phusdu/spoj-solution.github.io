title:  MOZHSLM - Sharmeen Loves Mozahid Loves Sharmeen [ HARD ]
categories: ['uncategorized']
code: MOZHSLM

### **Statement**

Mozahid & Sharmeen loves each other & spend a lots of time together. One day
they found a string which contains only lowercase english letters. As Mozahid
loves Sharmeen very much he likes all ‘s’ in the string. On the other hand as
Sharmeen loves Mozahid very much she likes all the ‘m’ in the string. Sharmeen
always want to stay on both sides(left & right) of Mozahid so that no other
girl can take him away from her :P. So, this time Mozahid gives her a task.
Mozahid told her, if she can tell him how many different subsequence of ‘
sms ’ exist in that string, he will ensure her that no girl will take him
away from her. As Sharmeen is not a programmer, she needs your help to perform
this task. Can you do this for her?

### Input

In the first line given an integer T( 1 <= T <= 10 ), the number of test
cases.

In each test case given a string S of size N( 1 <= N <= 10^5 ) of lowercase
English letters.

### Output

For each test case print the number of different subsequence of ‘sms’ exist on
that string in one line. For clearance ‘skmjssm’ has 2 different subsequence
of ‘sms’. {1,3,5} & {1,3,6} ( 1 based position ). For better understanding see
the sample input output.

### Example

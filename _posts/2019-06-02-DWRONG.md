### **Statement**

In elementary school, students learn to subtract fractions by first getting a
common denominator and then subtracting the numerators. However, sometimes a
student will work the problem incorrectly and still arrive at the correct
answer. For example, for the problem

5/4 - 9/12

one can subtract the numbers in the numerator and then subtract the numbers in
the denominator, simplify and get the answer. i.e.

5/4 - 9/12 = -4/-8 = 4/8 = 1/2

For a given fraction b/n, your task is to find all of the values a and m,
where a≥0 and m>0, for which

a/m - b/n = (a-b)/(m-n)

### Input

There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will consist of
a single line with two integers, b and n (1≤b,n≤10<sup>6</sup>) separated
by a single space. The input will end with a line with two 0s.

### Output

For each case, output all of the requested fractions on a single line, sorted
from smallest to largest. For equivalent fractions, print the one with the
smaller numerator first. Output each fraction in the form “a/m” with no spaces
immediately before or after the “/”. Output a single space between fractions.
Output no extra spaces, and do not separate answers with blank lines.

### Example Input

    
    
    9 12   
    12 14   
    4 12   
    0 0

### Example Output

    
    
    0/24 5/20 8/16 8/8 5/4   
    0/28 9/21 9/7   
    0/24 3/18 3/6

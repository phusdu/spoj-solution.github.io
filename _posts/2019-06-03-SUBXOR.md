### **Statement**

A straightforward question. Given an array of positive integers you have to
print the number of subarrays whose XOR is less than K. Subarrays are
defined as a sequence of continuous elements A<sub>i</sub>,
A<sub>i+1</sub>, ..., A<sub>j</sub>. XOR of a subarray is defined as
A<sub>i</sub> ^ A<sub>i+1</sub> ^ ... ^ A<sub>j</sub>. Symbol
^ is Exclusive Or. You can read more about it here:

### Input Format:

First line contains T , the number of test cases. Each of the test case
consists of N and K in one line, followed by N space separated
integers in next line.

### Output Format:

For each test case, print the required answer.

### Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10  
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5  
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5  
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^6  
Sum of N over all testcases will not exceed 10^5.

### Sample Input:

    
    
    1
    5 2
    4 1 3 2 7	

### Sample Output:

    
    
    3

### Explanation:

Only subarrays satisfying the conditions are [1], [1,3,2] and [3,2].

### **Statement**

A palindrome is a string that is the same as its reverse. Example "malayalam",
"dad", "appa" etc. In this problem you are asked to find the length of the
longest contiguous substring of a given string, which is a palindrome.

Input  

The first line consists of a single integer N, the no. of characters in the
string. 1 <= N <= 100000.  

Second line is a string with N characters, where the characters are always
lowercase english alphabets, ie 'a' to 'z'.

Output  


A single line with an integer representing the length of longest palindromic
substring.

Example  


    
    
    Input:  
    
    
     5  
    ababaÂ 
    
    
    Output:  
    
    
     5

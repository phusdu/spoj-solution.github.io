### **Statement**

In this problem you have to find the Square Root for given number. You may
assume that such a number exist and it will be always an integer.

Solutions to this problem can be submitted in C, C++, Pascal, Algol,
Fortran, Ada, Ocaml, Prolog, Whitespace, Brainfk and Intercal only.

### Input

_t_ \- the number of test cases [t  <= 50]  
then _t_ positive numbers follow, each of them have up to 800 digits in
decimal representation.  

### Output

Output must contain exactly t numbers equal to the square root for given
numbers. See sample input/output for details.

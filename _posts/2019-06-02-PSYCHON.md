### **Statement**

Problem Statement:

Given an integer N, the number N is called “ Psycho Number ” . Psycho
Number is calculated as follows:

First, If we factorize N , then we have some prime and their power. Assume
that, there are M powers. From M powers , you should count the number of even
and odd powers. Then if the number of even power is strictly greater than odd
power , then we call the number N is “ Psycho Number ”, otherwise the
number N is call “ Ordinary Number ”.

As for example, if N = 67500 then prime factorization,

67500 = 2<sup>2 </sup>x 3<sup>3 </sup>x 5<sup>4</sup>.

    
    
    Count even powers and odd powers . This number have 2 even power(2,4) and 1 odd power ( 3 ). Since even power 2 (2,4) is greater than odd power 1 (3), so the number 67500 is a Psycho Number.

Input:

An integer T (1  <= T <= 10<sup>6</sup>) denoting the number of
test cases followed by T lines. Each containing a single integer N ( 1  <=
N <= 10<sup>7</sup> ) .

Output:

For each case print “ Psycho Number ” or “ Ordinary Number ”.

### **Statement**

When trying to clean your old room, you find out your old notes from high
school.  
Reading the homeworks you were given then, you start thinking how much easier
they  
would have been today. However, there is a particular one that still seems to
maintain  
its difficulty.

When the solution to a problem involved solving the square root of an integer,
to keep  
a fancy and clean expression, you were asked to express it as the integer part
and the  
root part. This means that if you had as solution N you were asked to express
it  
as √N = A √B with the part A being as high as possible. For instance, 180 can
be  
expressed as 1 √180, 2 √45, 3 √20 or 6 √5. Of course, the last expression is
the correct  
one.

Now that you are grown up, you decide to write a program to perform this task
for you.

### Input

The input contains several test cases, each one described in a single line.
The line contains  
an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>18</sup> ). The last line of the input
contains a single −1 and should  
not be processed as a test case.

### Output

For each test case output a single line with two integers A and B separated by
a single  
space such that √N = A √B and A is maximum.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     180  
    17  
    1000000000000000000  
    -1  
      
     Output:
    6 5  
     1 17  
    1000000000 1

### **Statement**

You will be given T (T<=10^6) pair of numbers. All you have to tell is the
number of common divisors between two numbers in each pair.

### Input

First line of input: T (Number of test cases)  
In next T lines, each have one pair A B (0 < A, B <= 10^6)

### Output

One integer describing number of common divisors between two numbers.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3  
     100000 100000  
    12 24  
    747794 238336
    
    
    Output:
    36  
     6

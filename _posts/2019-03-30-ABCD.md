### **Statement**

Consider a table with 2 rows and 2N columns (a total of 4N cells). Each cell
of the first row is coloured by one of the colours A, B, C, D such that there
are no two adjacent cells of the same colour. You have to colour the second
row using colours A, B, C, D such that:

  * There are exactly N cells of each colour (A, B, C and D) in the table.
  * There are no two adjacent cells of the same colour. (Adjacent cells share a vertical or a horizontal side.)

It is guaranteed that the solution, not necessarily unique, will always exist.

### Input

[a natural number N â‰¤ 50000]

[a string of 2N letters from the set {A, B, C, D}, representing the first row
of the table]

### Output

[a string of 2N letters from the set {A, B, C, D}, representing the second row
of the table]

### **Statement**

S.H.I.E.L.D. is recruiting soldiers for the battle with Loki's army. Nick Fury
has come to Manhattan to find a large area of land to be used for training
purposes. He meets a popular landlord there who is a little foolish by nature.  
He gives square pieces of land with integral sides and charges on the basis of
number of pieces of land bought irrespective of how large a piece of land is.
Fury has to buy exactly A square units of land. Help Fury by determining
the minimum number of pieces that should be bought in order to minimize the
expenditure.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of
test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer A
denoting the area that nick fury want to buy.

  *10 ≤ T ≤ 100000
  *1 ≤ A ≤ 1000

### Output

For each test case print the minimum number of pieces that should be bought.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4
    1
    2
    3

    Output:
    1
    2
    3
    2

### Explanation

For the last test case 10 the answer will be 2. 10 can be expressed as sum of
minimum two squares that is 10 = 3<sup>2</sup>+1<sup>2</sup>.

### **Statement**

PP numbers are prime numbers and palindromes in decimal notation at once. Your
task is to find _n_ -th PP number in ascending order. Then calculate product
of its non-zero digits - let's call it _m_ \- and find _m_ -th prime number in
ascending order.

### Input

In the first line of input there is one positive integer _Z_ (1 ≤ _Z_ ≤ 1000)
which states the number of test cases. Following _Z_ lines contain test cases.

Each test case consists of one positive integer _n_ (1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 113) which
states the number of PP number to find.

### Output

For each test case print in separate line two numbers: _n_ -th PP number and
_m_ -th prime number.

### Example

Input:

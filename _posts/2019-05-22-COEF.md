### **Statement**

The problem is to calculate the coefficients in expansion of polynomial
_(x<sub>1</sub>+x<sub>2</sub>+...+x<sub>k</sub>)<sup>n</sup>_.

### Input

The input will consist of a set of pairs of lines. The first line of the pair
consists of two integers _n_ and _k_ separated with space ( _0 < n, k <13_).
This integers define the power of the polynomial and the amount of the
variables. The second line in each pair consists of _k_ non-negative integers
_n<sub>1</sub>, ..., n<sub>k</sub>,_ where
_n<sub>1</sub>+...+n<sub>k</sub>=n_.

### Output

For each input pair of lines the output line should consist one integer, the
coefficient by the monomial
_x<sub>1</sub><sup>n1</sup>x<sub>2</sub><sup>n2</sup>...x<sub>k</sub><sup>nk</sup>_
in expansion of the polynomial
_(x<sub>1</sub>+x<sub>2</sub>+...+x<sub>k</sub>)<sup>n</sup>_.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2 2
    1 1
    2 12
    1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

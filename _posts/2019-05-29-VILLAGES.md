### **Statement**

In a far away country there is a wide river, N villages on the left and N
villages on the right side of this river (denoted by 1..N on each side). There
are also M small ships, each of them connecting one village from the left and
one village from the right side (in both ways).

You are to organize a film festival in four of these villages: two from the
left and two from the right side. Each two of these four villages must be
connected by a ship (directly) if they belong to opposite sides of the river.

Help yourself to choose these four villages and first find out; in how many
ways can you choose them?

### Input

In the first line there are integers N ≤ 1000 and M ≤ N<sup>2</sup>.

In the next M lines there are two integers from the interval [1, N]
representing the village from the left and the village from the right side
connected by this ship.

### Output

Print the required number of ways to choose villages for the festival.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3 5  
     1 1  
    1 2  
    1 3  
    2 2  
    2 3  
    
    Output:
    1  
      
     (the only possibility is to choose the villages 1, 2 from the left and 2, 3 from the right side)

### **Statement**

A beehive is an enclosed structure in which some honey bee species live and
raise their  
young. In this problem we consider a two-dimensional sketch of the beehives.
Each  
beehive is composed of a certain number of cells, where each cell is a regular
hexagon.  
Each cell may have some neighbors, which are other cells that share a side
with that cell.  
A cell with exactly 6 neighbors is an internal cell, while a cell with fewer
neighbors is an  
external one. Notice that an external cell can always be changed to internal
by adding  
some neighbor cells.

  
We are interested in a particular class of beehives. This class of valid
beehives is defined  
recursively as follows: a) a single cell is a valid beehive; and b) given a
valid beehive B,  
if we add the minimum number of cells such that each external cell of B
becomes an  
internal cell, the result is a valid beehive.

The number of cells in a valid beehive is called a beehive number. Given an
integer N ,  
you must decide whether it is a beehive number.

### Input

Each test case is described using a single line. The line contains an integer
N (1 ≤ N ≤  
10<sup>9</sup> ). The end of input is indicated with a line containing a
single −1.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an uppercase “Y” if N is a
beehive  
number, or an uppercase “N” otherwise.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     43  
    1  
    7  
    19  
    15  
    -1  
    
    Output:  
     N  
    Y  
    Y  
    Y  
    N

### **Statement**

Given n points in a plane find the diameter of the smallest circle that
encloses all the points. A point lying on the circle is also considered to be
inside it

### Input

First line of input contains the n (<301) the number of points in the plane ,
followed by n lines of input  
Each line gives the coordinates of one point on the plane. Each coordinate is
an integer in the range [0,1000]

### Output

Output consists of a single real number, the diameter of the circle rounded to
two decimal places.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
    
    
    
    4  
     1 1  
    1 0  
    0 1  
    0 0  
    

  
  
Output:  
1.41

### **Statement**

" Lucius Fox: This conversation used to end with an unusual request.

Bruce Wayne: I'm retired.

Lucius Fox: Well let me show you some stuff anyway. Just for old time's sake.
"

Eight years after Harvey Dent's death, the Dent Act allowed eradication of
organized crime . BATMAN has disappeared . Wayne enterprises is unprofitable
after Bruce discontinued his fusion reactor project . A masked man called Bane
who was trained under Ra's al Ghul captures Gordon . Bane attacks the Gotham
Stock Exchange, using Bruce's fingerprints in a transaction that bankrupts
Wayne .

Now that gotham city was heading into deep deep trouble , Its time for BATMAN
to return .

However , since the company no longer belongs to Bruce Wayne , Mr. Wayne has
very little funds to spend on buying his weaponaries.

Mr Fox head him to the place where all weapons are stored .

Now these weapons come in batches properly sealed for safety .Each of these
batches will have an unbounded number of weapons of different types . To buy
these weapons Wayne initially need to pay the price for opening the seal .
Then each of these weapons have a cost and a power rating associated with it .
Mr Wayne needs to spend wisely on it to maximize the power rating using
limited amount of money.

People of Gotham , he needs your help for choosing his weaponaries .

### Input

t , number of testcases  
integers n m k,  
n: no of batches , m: no of weaponaries per batch , k : Money wayne can spend
on weaponaries

n intergers giving cost of opening the ith batch  
n*m numbers denoting cost of jth object from ith batch  
n*m numbers denoting the rating oj jth object from ith batch

### Output

The maximum power rating Wayne could afford

Constraints :  
1<= n,m <=20  
k <= 1000  
cost[i] <=20 , rating[i] <=100

### **Statement**

It's exam day and as usual Halum is running late. He has only T minutes to
go the the exam hall before it starts. There are two types of transports to go
to the University. He can go via Bus which takes B minutes or he can take
a CNG which takes C minutes. If he can reach the hall by Bus or CNG in
time, he will always choose the Bus. As a lazy guy Halum doesn't like to walk
but if he can't reach the university by Bus or CNG in time he will try
walking. It takes W minutes to go to the university if he walks. Walking
is sometimes faster than Bus or CNG because of heavy traffic. Even then if
it's impossible to reach the exam hall by any of the described ways he'll just
miss the exam.

Now, given T, B, C and W, you will have to find out which transport Halum
should take to go to the university or tell us if he's too late.

### Input

In the first line of input there will be four integers T B C W (1 <=T,
B, C, W<= 100).

### Output

Output one line describing the answer to the question. If he can go via Bus
print "Bus" , if he can go via CNG print "CNG" , if those fails but he
can go by foot print "Walk". If it's impossible to reach in time print
"Too Late". All output should be without the quotes. See sample input
output for clarification.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    30 25 27 30
    
    Output:
    Bus
    
    
    
    Input:
    30 35 38 47
    
    Output:
    Too Late

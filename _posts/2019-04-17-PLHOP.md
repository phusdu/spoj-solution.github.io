### **Statement**

This man has grown so rich that, when he travels between any two locations he
always takes atleast K flights. In a region of N cities, we need to find the
minimal cost required for the man to travel between every pair of cities.
There are provisions (especially for this type of rich men,) to fly from i-th
city to the i-th city itself!

### Input

T – The number of test cases.  
In each test case :  
K N  
NxN matrix representing the costs of the tickets. The i-th line, j-th column’s
entry represents the cost of a ticket from city i to city j. The numbers are
of course space separated.

Constraints :  
T <=20  
N<=50  
K<=10<sup>9</sup>  
The cost of each ticket <= 100  
Each element of the output matrix will fit into a 64-bit integer.  

### Output

For the i-th test case , 1st line is of the form “Region #i:”.  
In the following N lines, output an NxN matrix where the j-th element of the
i-th line represents the minimal cost to travel from city i to city j with
taking atleast K flights. The numbers on a line must be separated by atleast
one space. Output a blank line after each testcase (including the last one).

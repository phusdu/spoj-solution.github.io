### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug has grown many plants. She was trying to grow all plants with
equal size. Now she is wondering about the biggest difference between heights
of two plants which are near each other. Plants are near each other, if there
are at most K plants between them.

### Input

The first line contains T , the number of test-cases. The first line of
each test-case will contain N, K , 1 < N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> , 0 ≤
K ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> where N indicates number of plants.

Next line will contain N integers 0 ≤ h<sub>i</sub> ≤
10<sup>9</sup> indicating height of i-th plant.

Sum of all N among all test-cases won't exceed
3*10<sup>6<sup></sup></sup>

### Output

For each test-case, print exactly one number - the biggest difference of
plants near each other (biggest h<sub>i</sub>-h<sub>j</sub> such
that |i-j|-1 ≤ K ).

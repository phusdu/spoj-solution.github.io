### **Statement**

Given a undirected graph with n veritces and m edges. Your taks is count the
number of distinct pairs (u, v) that there is exist a path with length exactly
2 from u to v. Another mean, with each pair (u, v), we could find a vertex t
that we have an edge (u, t) and (t, v). The input set may be contains multiple
edge between any vertex and not consider to connected.

### Input

\- First line: n, m (1 <= n, m <= 10^5).

\- m following line: u, v (1 <= u, v <= n).

### Output

The number of distinct pairs.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    5 4  
     2 1  
    1 5  
    3 1  
    4 3  
      
     Output:
    4
      
    Note: we have (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 5)

### **Statement**

Hemlata and Ragini were playing a game from a number of coins. Hemlata was
jealous of Ragini. She wanted to win at all cost. A stack consists of n
coins. Any player can take either 1, 2 or 5 (anyone number of coins) coins
from stack at a time. Both Hemlata and Ragini play their moves alternatively.

Hemlata always starts first. Both play optimally. Your job is to predict the
output beforehand. A player who can't take any coin loses the game. A player
can take only one of 1, 2, 5 number of coins at a time in a move.

### Input

First line contains number of testcases t. 0  < t <= 10^5

An integer n denoting number of coins. 0  <= n <= 10^18

### Output

For each testcase printf "Hemlata" if Hemlata wins, else print "Ragini" if
Ragini wins (without quotes) in different lines .

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    1
    2
    3
    
    
    Output:
    Hemlata

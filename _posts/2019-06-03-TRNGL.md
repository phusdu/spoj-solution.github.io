### **Statement**

Chayanika loves Mathematics. She is learning a new chapter geometry. While
reading the chapter a question came in her mind. Given a convex polygon of n
sides. In how many ways she can break it into triangles, by cutting it with
(n-3) non-adjacent diagonals and the diagonals do not intersect.

### Input

First line of the input will be an integer t (1<=t<=100000) which is the no of
test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (3<=n<=1000) which is
the size of the polygon.

### Output

For each test case output the no of ways %100007.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2  
     3  
    5  
      
    Â Output:

### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug is a well known mathematician. Next week she is going to
represent her school in Mathematic Olympiad. There are many schools
participating and each of them has many students. Anyway only some of the
students and only some of the schools will be availible to participate in the
Olympiad. Question is, how many combinations of students can participate in
the Olympiad?

More specifically: There are N schools from which exactly A will
participate. Moreover there are B students in each school and exactly
D of them will participate in the Olympiad.

Ada could count it herself. But this process takes too much time and the
limits for schools and students are changing every moment so she has decided
to make a program for it (in fact she has decided that you will make the
program for her)!

### Input

The input contains up to 10<sup>4</sup> lines, each containing four
integers N,A,B,D , 1 ≤ A ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> , 1 ≤ D ≤ B ≤
10<sup>6</sup>

### Output

For each line print the number of combination of students, which can
participate in the Olympiad. All students and universities are
distinguishable, but their order doesn't matter.

Since the anwer might be huge, print it modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7 (
1000000007 )

### **Statement**

### Background

This problem is somewhat easier than the problem [A Very Easy
Problem!](http://www.spoj.com/problems/EASYPROB) because of the super long
time limit...

### Description

Assurance Company of Moving (ACM) is a company of moving things for people.
Recently, some schools want to move their computers to another place. So they
ask ACM to help them. One school reserves _K_ trucks for moving, and it has
_N_ computers to move. In order not to waste the trucks, the school ask ACM to
use all the trucks. That is to say, there must be some computers in each
truck, and there are no empty trucks. ACM wants to know how many partition
shemes exists with moving N computers by K trucks, the ACM ask you to compute
the number of different shemes with given N and K. You needn't care with the
order. For example _N_ =7, _K_ =3, the the following 3 partition instances are
regarded as the same one and should be counted as one sheme: "1 1 5","1 5
1","5 1 1". Each truck can carry almost unlimited computers!!

### Input

Each line of the input contains two postisive integer N (1<=N<=5000) and
K(1<=K<=N).Input is terminated by a line with N=K=0(this case should not be
processed).

### Output

For each line, output the number of different partition sheme. To avoid big
integers, you may output the answer modudo 1988.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     1 1  
    7 3  
    0 0  
      
     Output:  
     1  
    4

### **Statement**

We all know about prime numbers, prime number is a natural number greater than
1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

We can Classify the numbers by its number of divisors, as n-divisors-numbers,
for example number 1 is 1-divisor number, number 4 is 3-divisors-number...
etc.

Note : All prime numbers are 2-divisors numbers.

Example:  
8 is a 4-divisors-number [1, 2, 4, 8].

### Input

Three integers a, b, n.

### Output

Print single line the number of n-divisors numbers between a and b inclusive.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1 7 2
    
    Output:
    4

### Constraints

1  <= a, b <=10^9  
0 <= b - a <= 10^4  
1 <= n <= 100

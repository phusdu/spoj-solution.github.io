### **Statement**

Given N, M and K (1 <= N, M <= 100^200 and 1 <= K <= 16) which  
  
N = a + b  
M = a^2 + b^2 - (2^K - 2) * a * b  
  
with a > 0, b > 0 and gcd(a, b) = 1.  
  
Your task is to find gcd(N, M).

### Input

The input file consists of several data sets. The first line contains  
the number of data sets T (1 <= T <= 10000). The fallowing T lines  
describe the data sets, one triple (N, M, K) for each.

### Output

For each data test in the input write the gcd(N, M).

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
      
     2  
    648570884104668119354133 420644191708310845403065233058235585438328857465 5  
    8017723549 59173349743176010825 9  
    
    Output:  
      
     1  
    1  
    
    
     *
    
      
    Note: For the first trio a = 648570884104668119354126 and b = 7.  
    For the second a = 8016478423 and b = 1245126.

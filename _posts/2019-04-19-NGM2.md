### **Statement**

Little Chikoo likes to play with numbers. Often he plays the following game:

  1. He chooses a number N and a set of positive integers.
  2. He writes down all the numbers from 1 to N.
  3. He chooses the first number (say x) from the set and cancels out all the multiples of x from 1 to N, including x.
  4. He repeats step 3 for all the numbers from the set.

One day Little Chikoo was in a mood to play pranks. So his brother asked him
to play the game with a certain challenge. He made the game a little harder
and asked him to find out the number of integers which aren't cancelled after
he completes step 4. If he does that then Little Chikoo gets to play on his
brother's Nintendo for one full day. Now Little Chikoo is in a hurry and wants
to finish the job as soon as possible. He has asked for your help.

### Input

The first line of the input contains N and K. (N <= 10^9, K <= 15)

Then K numbers follow all in a single line. All numbers are <= 100.

### Output

The output file must contain the number of integers that aren't cancelled
after he finishes step 4 of the game.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    10 3
    2 4 5
    
    Output:
    4
    

(The numbers 1, 3, 7 and 9 weren't cancelled).

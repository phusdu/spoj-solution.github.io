### **Statement**

Weird Wally's Wireless Widgets, Inc. manufactures an eclectic assortment of
small, wireless, network capable devices, ranging from dog collars, to
pencils, to fishing bobbers. All these devices have very small memories.
Encryption algorithms like Rijndael, the candidate for the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) are demonstrably secure but they don't fit in such a tiny
memory. In order to provide some security for transmissions to and from the
devices, WWWW uses the following algorithm, which you are to implement.

Encrypting a message requires three integer keys, _k<sub>1</sub>_ ,
_k<sub>2</sub>_ , and _k<sub>3</sub>_. The letters [a-i] form one
group, [j-r] a second group, and everything else ([s-z] and underscore) the
third group. Within each group the letters are rotated _left_ by
_k<sub>i</sub>_ positions in the message. Each group is rotated
independently of the other two. Decrypting the message means doing a _right_
rotation by _k<sub>i</sub>_ positions within each group.

Consider the message ` the_quick_brown_fox` encrypted with _k<sub>i</sub>_
values of 2, 3 and 1. The encrypted string is ` _icuo_bfnwhoq_kxert`. The
figure below shows the decrypting right rotations for one character in each of
the three character groups.

Looking at all the letters in the group [a-i] we see {`i`,`c`,`b`,`f`,`h`,`e`}
appear at positions {2,3,7,8,11,17} within the encrypted message. After a
right rotation of _k<sub>1</sub>_ =2, these positions contain the letters
{`h`,`e`,`i`,`c`,`b`,`f`}. The table below shows the intermediate strings that
come from doing all the rotations in the first group, then all rotations in
the second group, then all the rotations in the third group. Rotating letters
in one group will not change any letters in any of the other groups.

| [a-i], _k<sub>1</sub>_ = 2 | [j-r], _k<sub>2</sub>_ = 3 | [s-z] and
_, _k<sub>3</sub>_ = 1

All input strings contain only lowercase letters and underscores(_). Each
string will be at most 80 characters long. The _k<sub>i</sub>_ are all
positive integers in the range 1-100.

Input consists of information for one or more encrypted messages. Each problem
begins with one line containing _k<sub>1</sub>_ , _k<sub>2</sub>_ ,
and _k<sub>3</sub>_ followed by a line containing the encrypted message.
The end of the input is signalled by a line with all key values of 0.

For each encrypted message, the output is a single line containing the
decrypted string.

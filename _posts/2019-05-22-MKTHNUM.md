### **Statement**

[English](/problems/MKTHNUM/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/MKTHNUM/vn/)  
---|---  
  
You are working for Macrohard company in data structures department. After
failing your previous task about key insertion you were asked to write a new
data structure that would be able to return quickly k-th order statistics in
the array segment.

That is, given an array a[1 ... n] of different integer numbers, your program
must answer a series of questions Q(i, j, k) in the form: "What would be the
k-th number in a[i ... j] segment, if this segment was sorted?"

For example, consider the array a = (1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4). Let the question be
Q(2, 5, 3). The segment a[2 ... 5] is (5, 2, 6, 3). If we sort this segment,
we get (2, 3, 5, 6), the third number is 5, and therefore the answer to the
question is 5.

### Input

The first line of the input contains n — the size of the array, and m — the
number of questions to answer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000).

The second line contains n different integer numbers not exceeding 10^9 by
their absolute values — the array for which the answers should be given.

The following m lines contain question descriptions, each description consists
of three numbers: i, j, and k (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ j - i + 1) and
represents the question Q(i, j, k).

    1 5 2 6 3 7 4
    2 5 3
    4 4 1
    1 7 3
    
    

### Output

    
    
     
    For each question output the answer to it — the k-th number in sorted 
    a[i ... j] segment.

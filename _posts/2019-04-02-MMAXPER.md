title:  MMAXPER - Rectangles Perimeter
categories: ['dynamic-programming']
code: MMAXPER
src: MMAXPER.cpp

### **Statement**

[English](/problems/MMAXPER/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/MMAXPER/vn/)  
---|---  
  
Given are n rectangles, numbered from 1 to n. We place them tightly on the
axis OX, from left to right, according to rectangles' numbers. Each rectangle
stays on the axis OX either by its shorter or by its longer side (see the
picture below). Compute the length of the upper envelop line, i.e. perimeter's
length of the obtained figure minus the length of the left, right and bottom
straight line segments of the picture. Write program to find the maximum
possible length of the upper envelop line.

### Input

On the first line of the standard input, the value of n is written. On each of
the next n lines, two integers are given – a_i and b_i – the side lengths of
the i_th rectangle.

Constraints: 0 < n < 1000; 0 < a_i < b_i < 1000, for each i = 1, 2, …, n.

### Output

On a line of the standard output, your program should write the result as a
positive integer.

    
    
    SAMPLE INPUT:
    5
    2 5
    3 8
    1 10
    7 14
    2 5
    
    
    
    SAMPLE OUTPUT:
    68
    

### Explanation

A configuration, that yields the maximum length of the upper envelopline, is
presented on the picture. The upper envelop line consists of segments DC, CG,
GF, FJ, JI, IM, ML, LP, and PO. The total length is 5 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 10 + 13 +
7 + 12 + 5 = 68

### **Statement**

Problem [BRIDGE](/problems/BRI/) has shown that you are able to build the
cheap bridge through the river very quickly. Now you will not have problems
with time limit. You will have problems with number of bridges.

### Input

There is a single positive integer _T_ on the first line of input. It stands
for the number of test cases to follow. Each test case is exactly five lines,
containing description of the route between two cities A and B, located on
opposite sides of the rivers.

_n  
a<sub>0</sub> a<sub>1</sub> a<sub>2</sub> ... a<sub>n</sub>  
h<sub>1</sub> h<sub>2</sub> ... h<sub>n</sub>  
c  
s<sub>0</sub> s<sub>1</sub> s<sub>2</sub> ... s<sub>n</sub>  
_

Here _n_ is the number of the rivers which are parallel to each other,
_a<sub>i</sub>_ \- the distances between rivers or between rivers and
cities, _h<sub>i</sub>_ \- the widths of the rivers, _c_ \- the distance
between A and B along the axis parallel to the river, _s<sub>i</sub>_ \-
the costs of the unit of the bridge through _i<sub>th</sub>_ river and
_s<sub>0</sub>_ \- the cost of the unit of the road. Example for _n_ =2
you can see on the picture.

All integers in input are positive and less than 50, except _c_ \- it is less
than 2000.

### Output

For each test case your program should write a single number to the standard
output, equal to the minimal total cost of the route between A and B, accurate
up to two digits after the decimal dot.

### Example

### Dating Rishi

Its been Monday and [Rishi](http://www.facebook.com/iRishiKumar) Dudeis
planning to select a girl to date for this week. So all N girls are standing
in a line from 1 to N so that Rishi will select one of them. The girls are
standing in a straight line but randomly. They know they cannot predict what
Rishi The Great likes, He may like _hot, smart, tall, short, witty, white,
black_ or anything. But wait, Rishi, the Coolest Dude plans to date two girls
this week !!! _How lucky they are ????_. But he wants to select two girls
whose friendship quotient is maximum so that they wont fight too much over

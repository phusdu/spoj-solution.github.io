title:  CUBNUM - Cube Numbers
categories: ['simple-math', 'dynamic-programming']
code: CUBNUM
src: CUBNUM.cpp

### **Statement**

For any positive integer n, n can be represented as sum of other positive cube
numbers
(n=a<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup>+a<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>+...+a<sub>m</sub><sup>3</sup>).
Your task is to print the smallest m, where m is number of cube numbers used
to form n, such that
n=a<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup>+a<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>+...+a<sub>m</sub><sup>3</sup>.
For example:

  * n=5,n=1<sup>3</sup>+1<sup>3</sup>+1<sup>3</sup>+1<sup>3</sup>+1<sup>3</sup> (m=5)
  * n=8,n=2<sup>3</sup> (m=1)
  * n=35,n=2<sup>3</sup>+3<sup>3</sup> (m=2)

Note: My fastest time is 0.09s :).  
Edit: My fastest time is 0.05s now lol  
My Java solution is also accepted.

### Input

Input consists of several test cases separated by new lines. Each test case
consists of a positive integer, denoting the number of n (1 ≤ n ≤
10<sup>5</sup>). Input is terminated by end of file (EOF).  
It is guaranteed that total test case per input file is less than
10<sup>5</sup>.  
  
Note: For c++ users, you can use while(scanf("%d", &n)!=EOF); to read input
until EOF.  
Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages!.

### Output

For each case, print "Case #X: M", where X (1 ≤ X ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>) is the
case number,and M is the minimum cube numbers used to form the integer n.
There must be no trailing spaces at the end of printed lines, neither empty
characters. Print a newline after each testcase.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    2
    5
    8
    35
    
    Output:
    Case #1: 1
    Case #2: 2
    Case #3: 5
    Case #4: 1
    Case #5: 2

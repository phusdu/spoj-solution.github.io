### **Statement**

You are given a set of N sticks and are required to partition them into groups
of exactly 3 sticks each. While doing so, you can leave out any number of
sicks out of these groups (in particular, no groups may be formed). One
condition needs to be met: sticks in each group need to form a triangle. A
triangle can be constructed if sum of any two sticks lengths is greater than
the third length.

Your are required to partition the sticks so that the sum of triangle areas
from all the groups is maximized.

  

### Input

Very first line of the input contains integer T: number of test cases (1 <= T
<= 5).

For each test case, first line contains integer N: number of sticks. (1 <= N
<= 15).

Second line contains N space separated integers: the lengths l<sub>i</sub>
of the sicks. (1 <= l<sub>i</sub> <= 10^3, 1 <= i <= N).

  

### Output

For each test case, output the maximal area in a separate line. Round value to
exactly 6 decimal places. Always print exactly 6 decimal places.

  

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     3  
    3  
    7 8 5   
    4  
    7 8 6 3   
    3  
    7 2 1  
      
     Output:  
     17.320508  
    20.333163  
    0.000000

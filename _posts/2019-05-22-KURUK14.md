### **Statement**

A Genie Sequence is a sequence in which every element indicates the number of
elements present before or after it. Given an array of numbers, find whether
you can form a Genie sequence or not.

### Input

First line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. It is
followed by T cases each of which contains two lines. First line of each test
case contains a single integer N. The next line contains N integers separated
by a single space.

### Output

For each test case output a single line containing "`YES`" (without quotes) if
it is possible to form a genie sequence or "`NO`" (without quotes) if it is
not possible.

### Constraints

1 <= T <= 20

2 <= N <= 1000

1 <= ai <= 1000

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    4
    1 3 3 2
    
    Output:
    YES

#### Explanation for the test case:

The Genie sequence is {3, 1, 2, 3}. The first element '3' in the sequence
indicates that three numbers are after it, the 2nd element '1' indicates that
one number if before it, the 3rd element '2' indicates that two elements are
before it and the last element indicates that three elements are before it. So
the answer is YES.

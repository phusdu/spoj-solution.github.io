### **Statement**

The fibonacci sequence is defined by the following relation:

  * F(0) = 0
  * F(1) = 1
  * F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), N >= 2

Your task is very simple. Given two non-negative integers N and M, you have to
calculate the sum (F(N) + F(N + 1) + ... + F(M)) mod 1000000007.

### Input

The first line contains an integer T (the number of test cases). Then, T lines
follow. Each test case consists of a single line with two non-negative
integers N and M.

### Output

For each test case you have to output a single line containing the answer for
the task.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    0 3
    3 5
    10 19
    
    Output:
    4
    10
    10857

### Constraints

  * T <= 1000
  * 0 <= N <= M <= 10<sup>9</sup>

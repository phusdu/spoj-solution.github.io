### **Statement**

You are given an array of size N. How many distinct arrays can you generate by
swapping two numbers for exactly once? The two selected numbers can be equal
but their positions in the array must be different.

### Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number
of test cases. Every test case starts with an integer N. The next line
contains N integers, the numbers of the array.

### Output

For each tescase output the answer in a single line.

### Constraints:

1 <= T <= 5

1 <= Value of a number in the array <= 100000

2 <= N <= 100000

  

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     1   
    5   
    2 3 2 3 3
    
    
    Output:
     7
    
    
    You can generate the following arrays:
    
    
    
    
    2 3 2 3 3
    
    
    
    
    2 2 3 3 3
    
    
    
    
    2 3 3 2 3
    
    
    
    
    2 3 3 3 2
    
    
    
    
    3 2 2 3 3
    
    
    
    
    3 3 2 2 3
    
    
    
    
    3 3 2 3 2

### **Statement**

Two girls - Ivica and Marica - play an interesting game.

First, they randomly choose a natural number N. They also define M = 1.

Ivica plays first, then Marica, then Ivica, then Marica and so on.

In each move, a girl has to increase M by 1 or multiply M by 2 (that is, M =
M+1 or M = 2*M). The resulting number must not be greater than N.

The loser of the game is the girl who gets M = N. The other girl is, of
course, the winner.

Write a program to determine the winner, assuming that both girls play
optimally.

### Input

In the first line there is an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 5), the number of games.

T lines follow. In i<sup>th</sup> line there is an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤
10<sup>15)</sup>, a chosen number for i<sup>th</sup> game.

### Output

For each of the T games print the name of the winner.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
    4  
     2  
    3  
    4  
    5  
    
    
    
    Output:  
      
     Marica  
    Ivica  
    Marica  
    Marica

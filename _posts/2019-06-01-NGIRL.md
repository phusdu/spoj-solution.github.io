### **Statement**

Namit's girlfriend birthday is coming next week.He went to a gift shop and saw
(N) gifts are arranged in a single row in such a way that the position at
which the gift is placed is equal to its price. (Position starts from 1.)

Namit's girlfriend being a maths student like those numbers which have exactly
3 divisors, so Namit decide to buy only those gifts which are placed at a
position which have only 3 divisors, but Namit's girlfriend likes gifts whose
price are above a certain amount (K).

Now Namit wants to know total choices he have and how many gifts his
girlfriend like for a given value of N.

### Input

Input starts with 1 <=T<=1000 (number of test cases). Then T lines follows
each containing two integer 1 <=N<10^10 (number of gifts at gift shop) and
1 <=K<=10^10.

### Output

You program should output two values indicating total number of choices and
the number of gifts Namit's girlfriend like.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3

    10 4
    
    
    Output:
    2 2

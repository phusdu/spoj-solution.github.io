### **Statement**

A long time ago, the Egyptians figured out that a triangle with sides of
length 3, 4, and 5 had a right angle as its largest angle. You must determine
if other triangles have a similar property.

### Input

Input represents several test cases, followed by a line containing 0 0 0. Each
test case has three positive integers, less than 30,000, denoting the lengths
of the sides of a triangle.

### Output

For each test case, a line containing "right" if the triangle is a right
triangle, and a line containing "wrong" if the triangle is not a right
triangle.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     6 8 10
    
    25 52 60
    
    6 8 10
    25 52 60
    5 12 13
    0 0 0
    
    
    5 12 13
    
    0 0 0
    
    
    Output:
    right
    wrong
    right

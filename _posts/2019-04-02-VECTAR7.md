### **Statement**

Changu and Mangu were playing volleyball, when they were handed a very easy
question about the game.You can help them solve it.

In volleyball 2 teams play with initial score 0 and each team gets points
which increases their

scores by 1.

The game ends when:

One of the teams gets 25 points and another team has < 24 points ( strictly
less than 24).

If the score ties at 24:24, the teams continue to play until the absolute
difference between the scores is 2.

Given the final score of a game ( A B ) i.e., the first team has scored A
points and the second has scored B points,

You have to find the number of different sequences of getting points by teams
that leads to this final score?

### Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T. The next T lines contain
two integers A and B.

### Output

Output the number of different sequences of getting points by the teams that
leads to the final score A : B. _Final_ means that the game should be over
after this score is reached. If the number is larger than 109+7, output number
modulo 109 \+ 7. Print 0 if no such volleyball game ends with the given score.

### Example

Input:

2

3 25

24 17

Output:

2925

0

Constraints:

T<=15

0 ≤ A , B ≤ 109

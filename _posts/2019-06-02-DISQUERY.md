### **Statement**

[English](/problems/DISQUERY/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/DISQUERY/vn/)  
---|---  
  
  

The traffic network in a country consists of N cities (labeled with integers
from 1 to N) and N-1 roads connecting the cities. There is a unique path
between each pair of different cities, and we know the exact length of each
road.

Write a program that will, for each of the K given pairs of cities, find the
length of the shortest and the length of the longest road on the path between
the two cities.

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer N, 2 ≤ N ≤ 100 000. Each of the
following N-1 lines contains three integers A, B and C meaning that there is a
road of length C between city A and city B.

The length of each road will be a positive integer less than or equal to 1 000
000.  
The next line contains an integer K, 1 ≤ K ≤ 100 000. Each of the following K
lines contains two different integers D and E – the labels of the two cities
constituting one query.

### Output

Each of the K lines of output should contain two integers – the lengths from
the task description for the corresponding pair of the cities.

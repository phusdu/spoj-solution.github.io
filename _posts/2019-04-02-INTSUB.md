### **Statement**

You are given a set X = {1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦ , 2n-1, 2n} where n is an integer. You
have to find the number of interesting subsets of this set X.

A subset of set X is interesting if there are at least two integers a & b such
that b is a multiple of a, i.e. remainder of b divides by a is zero and a is
the smallest number in the set.

### Input

The input file contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input is an
integer T(<=30) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines
contains an integer 'n' where 1<=n<=1000.

### Output

For each test case, you have to output as the format below:

Case X: Y

Here X is the test case number and Y is the number of subsets. As the number Y
can be very large, you need to output the number modulo 1000000007.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    
    
    1
    
    
    2
    
    
    3
    
    Output:
    Case 1: 1
    
    
    Case 2: 9
    
    
    Case 3: 47

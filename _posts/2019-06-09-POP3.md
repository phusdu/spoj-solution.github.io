### **Statement**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive
divisors other than 1 and itself.

we define here a new prime number called prime of primes number (POP) is a
prime number that consist of other prime numbers less than this number.

example:

1013 consist of 101 and 3 and both are primes.

notes :

2003 is not POP because leading zero not allowed.

The POP number must contain more than or equal two primes, and overlapping not
allowed.

### Input

The first line contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases (T <=
200) followed by T lines, each line contains an integer m number 0 <=m <=
10^27.

### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the first integer greater
than or equal to m and is (POP).

### Example

### **Statement**

Given an integer array of N integers, find the sum of bit differences in all
the pairs that can be formed from array elements. Bit difference of a pair (x,
y) is the count of different bits at the same positions in binary
representations of x and y. For example, bit difference for 2 and 7 is 2.
Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111 (first and last bits differ in
two numbers).

### Input

Input begins with a line containing an integer T(1 <=T<=100), denoting the
number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a
line containing an integer N(1 <=N<=10000), denoting the number of
integers in the array, followed by a line containing N space separated
32-bit integers.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line in the format Case X: Y , where
X denotes the test case number and Y denotes the sum of bit
differences in all the pairs that can be formed from array elements modulo
10000007.

### Example

    1
    4
    3 2 1 4
    
    Output:

title:  CATHETEN - Shared cathetus (easy)
categories: ['uncategorized']
code: CATHETEN
src: CATHETEN.cpp
---

### **Statement**

For any integer _n_ , we define _F_ ( _n_ ) as the number of ways in
which _n_ can be the cathetus (leg) of a Pythagorean triangle. For
example, there is exactly four Pythagorean triangles with 15 as a length for a
cathetus.

![catheten](../../content/francky:catheten)

(8 15 17), ( 15 20 25), ( 15 36 39), ( 15 112 113)

Thus _F_ (15) = 4.

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer _T_ , the number of test
cases.

Each of the next _T_ lines contains a single integer _n_.

### Output

For each test case, print _F_ ( _n_ ) on a single line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    5
    10
    15
    
    
    
    Output:
    1
    1
    4
    

### Constraints

    
    
    0 < T < 10^5
    0 < n < 10^9
    

For your information, my C code ran in 0.08s, whereas my python3 one ran in
0.90s. (Edit 2017-02-11, after compiler changes)

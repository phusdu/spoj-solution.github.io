### **Statement**

You are given a set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}. Your task is simple. You have to
calculate the number of ways of selecting non empty subsets A and B such that
A is not a subset of B and B is not a subset of A. Since answer can be large
output the result mod 10^9 + 7.

### Input

First line of input contains single integer t denoting number of test cases.

Next t lines contain a single integer n.

### Output

For each test case output answer to problem by taking mod with 10^9 + 7.

### Constraints

1 <= t <= 100000

1 <= n <= 1000000

### Example

    
    
    SAMPLE INPUT:
    2
    4
    8
    
    SAMPLE OUTPUT:
    110
    52670

### **Statement**

There is a string containing only decimal digit characters. The length of the
string is between _1_ and _1000_. Using characters of the string, you have to
construct the maximum number which divides by fifteen without remainder. Each
character of the string may not be used more than once.

### Input

First line of input contains an integer t ( _1_ ≤ t ≤ _90_ ), equal to
the number of testcases. Then descriptions of t testcases follow.

Each testcase is described in a single line representing the source string.

### Output

For each testcase output one line with the decimal representation of the
maximum number. Leading zeroes should be omitted. If no number can be
constructed, output a single word _“impossible”_.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    02041
    
    Output:
    4200

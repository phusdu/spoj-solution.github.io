### **Statement**

Pappu was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of
make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow. His mathâ€™s
teacher gives two numbers a and b. The problem consist in find the last digit
of the potency of base a and index b. Help Pappu with his problem. You are
given two integer numbers: the base a (number of digits d, such that 1 <= d <=
1000) and the index b (0 <= b <= 922*10^15). You have to find the last digit
of a^b.

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <=
30). t test cases follow. For each test case will appear a and b separated by
space.

### Output

For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.

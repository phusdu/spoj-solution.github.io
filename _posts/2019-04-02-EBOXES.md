### **Statement**

N large empty boxes (assume they are of type:1) are initially placed on a
table. An unknown number of boxes (type:1) are selected and in each of them
K smaller boxes (type:2) are placed. Again an unknown number of type:2
boxes are selected and K boxes of type:3 are placed inside. This process
is repeated T times. Now a box is assumed to be empty when it has no
smaller boxes inside it. Finally after all the processes are complete let
there be F empty boxes in total.

### LIMITS

1< N, K, T, F <1000000

### Input

First line of the input file contains the number of test cases. Then each line
contains 4 integers N, K, T, F as described above.

### Output

Each line should contain the total number of boxes on the table.

### Example

    
    
    Input:

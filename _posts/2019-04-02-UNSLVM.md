### **Statement**

Math is very favorite to Beak Sing Jo. He is a very brilliant student and
always attentive to his studies. Ohani is a girl of his class. She always
tries to be a friend of Beak Sing Jo. But Beak doesn’t like her at all. She is
never serious for her study. But she always tries to take the attention of
Beak.

So, one day Beak gave her a condition. If Ohani can solve a math, he will
accept her friendship. He gave Ohani the following question.

You will be given an integer n. You will have to find an integer number X of n
digits that satisfies the condition:

X + 2 = reverse (2*X)

Here reverse(x) means to arrange the digits of the number in the reverse
order.

Ohani is very weak in mathematics. But she knows that you are a great
programmer. So she told you to make a program for her which will solve the
question.

### Input

The first line of the input will be the number of test cases T where T <= 50.
Next T lines will contain an integer n and n will always be less than 300001.

### Output

You have to output the answer in the following format:

“Case y: x”

Where y is the case number and x is the desired n digit number

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     3
    
    1
    
    2
    
    3
    
    
    
    Output:
    
    
     Case 1: 2
    
    Case 2: 47
    
    Case 3: 497

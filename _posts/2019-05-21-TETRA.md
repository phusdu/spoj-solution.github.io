### **Statement**

Of course a Sphere Online Judge System is bound to have some tasks about
spheres. So here is one. Given the lengths of the edges of a tetrahedron
calculate the radius of a sphere inscribed in that tetrahedron (i.e. a sphere
tangent to all the faces).

### Input

Number N of test cases in a single line. ( N <= 30 ) Each of the next N lines
consists of 6 integer numbers -- the lengths of the edges of a tetrahedron
separated by single spaces. The edges are not longer than 1000 and for the
tetrahedron WXYZ, the order of the edges is: WX, WY, WZ, XY, XZ, YZ.

### Output

N lines, each consisting of a real number given with four digits decimal
precision equal to the radius of a sphere inscribed in the given tetrahedron.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    1000 999 998 5 5 6
    
    Output:
    0.2041

### **Statement**

Felix, the cat, decided to play in the afternoon with some melons, he built a
“melon launcher” and started pointing to targets. Soon he noticed that the
melons sometimes overflies the victims or don't even get close to them.

The melon launcher can be rotated so it can shoot from an angle from 0 to 45
degrees.

Felix isn't good at maths, so he ask you to code a program that, given the
target (in meters) distance and the speed (in meters / sec) you can give him
the perfect angle for the melon launcher.

The gravity to be considered is of 9.806 meters / sec^2

PI value to be considered is 2*acos(0.0).

### Input

The first line of input will contain an integer T denoting the T test cases,
then, T cases will follow. Each of the following line will contain two integer
numbers Ta and Sp, denoting the distance of the target and the speed of the
melon respectively.

### Output

Output the string “`Scenario #i: `“ where i is the test case you are analyzing
followed by a single number D, denoting the Degrees necessary to do the
launch, if the launching can't be done, output D as `-1`. the number must have
a precision of 2 decimal digits.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    10 10
    10 9
    8 9
    
    Output:
    Scenario #1: 39.35
    Scenario #2: -1
    Scenario #3: 37.79

### Constraints

0 < Ta, Sp < 10000

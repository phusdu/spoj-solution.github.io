### **Statement**

You are given a sequence A consisting of N integers (not to be confused with
the sequence from a previous

task). We will call the ith sequence element good if it equals the sum of some
three elements in positions

strictly smaller than i (an element can be used more than once in the sum).
How many good elements

does the sequence contain?

You are given a sequence A consisting of N integers (not to be confused with
the sequence from a previous

task). We will call the i<sup>th</sup> sequence element good if it equals
the sum of some three elements in positions

strictly smaller than i (an element can be used more than once in the sum).
How many good elements

does the sequence contain?

### Input

The first line of input contains the positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 5000), the
length of the se-

quence A. The second line of input contains N space separated integers
representing the sequence

A (−100000 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤ 100000).

### Output

The first and only line of output must contain the number of good elements in
the sequence.

### **Statement**

Mirko is a strange boy so he has written down a square matrix full of ones and
zeroes. Now he is interested in how many plusses there are in his matrix.

A plus is a square such that its side has an odd length greater than 1 and all
of its cells are zero, except for the middle row and the middle column: they
must be full of ones. For example, in the matrix below there are two plusses,
one inside the other:

00100  
00100  
11111  
00100  
00100

### Input

In the first line there is an integer N â‰¤ 2000, dimenzion of the square
matrix.

The next N lines are the rows of the matrix.

### Output

Print the number of plusses appearing in the matrix.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    8  
     00010000  
    00010000  
    00010000  
    11111111  
    00010000  
    00010010  
    00010111  
    00010010  
      
      
     Output:
    3

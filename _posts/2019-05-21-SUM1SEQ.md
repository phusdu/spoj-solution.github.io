### **Statement**

We say that a sequence of integers is a one-sequence if the difference between
any two consecutive numbers in this sequence is 1 or -1 and its first element
is 0. More precisely: [ _a_ <sub>1</sub>, _a_ <sub>2</sub>, ...,
_a<sub>n</sub>_ ] is a one-sequence if

  * for any _k_ , such that 1 <= _k_ < _n_ : | _a<sub>k</sub>_ \- _a<sub>k</sub>_ <sub>+1</sub>| = 1 and 
  * _a_ <sub>1</sub> = 0 

### Task

Write a program that for each test case:

  * reads two integers describing the length of the sequence and the sum of its elements; 
  * finds a one-sequence of the given length whose elements sum up to the given value or states that such a sequence does not exist; 
  * writes the result to the standard output.

### Input

The number of test cases _t_ is in the first line of input, then _t_ test
cases follow separated by an empty line.

In the first line of a test case there is a number _n_ , such that 1 <= _n_ <=
10 000, which is the number of elements in the sequence. In the second line
there is a number _S_ , which is the sum of the elements of the sequence, such
that | _S_ | <= 50 000 000.

### Output

For each test case there should be written _n_ integers (each integer in a
separate line) that are the elements of the sequence ( _k_ -th element in the
_k_ -th line) whose sum is _S_ or the word "No" if such a sequence does not
exist. If there is more than one solution your program should output any one.

Consequent test cases should by separated by an empty line.

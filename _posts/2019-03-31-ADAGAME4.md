### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug is playing Game of Divisors against her friend Velvet Mite
Vinit. The game has following rules. There is a pile of N stones between
them. The player who's on move can pick at least 1 an at most σ(N)
stones (where σ(N) stands for number of divisors of N ). Obviously,
N changes after each move. The one who won't get any stones ( N == 0 )
loses.

As Ada the Lady bug is a lady, so she moves first. Can you decide who will
be the winner? Assume that both players play optimally.

### Input

The first line of input will contain 1 ≤ T ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> , the
number of test-cases.

The next T lines will contain 1 ≤ N ≤ 2*10<sup>7</sup> , the
number of stones which are initially in pile.

### Output

Output the name of winner, so either "Ada" or "Vinit".

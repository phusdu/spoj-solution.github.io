### **Statement**

Numbers have feelings too! For any positive integer, take the sum of the
squares of each of its digits, and add them together. Take the result, and do
it again. A number is Happy if, after repeating this process a finite number
of times, the sum is 1. Some happy numbers take more iterations of this
process to get to 1 than others, and that would be referred to as its distance
from happiness. 1’s distance from happiness is 0. 23’s distance from happiness
is 3, since 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> = 13, 1<sup>2</sup> +
3<sup>2</sup> = 10, and 1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1. Numbers
are Unhappy if they are infinitely far away from happiness because they get
stuck in a loop.

Given the lower end and upper end of a range of integers, determine how many
Unhappy numbers are in that range (inclusive).

### Input

There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will consist
of two positive integers, lo and hi (0 < lo ≤ hi
≤10<sup>18</sup>) on a single line, with a single space between them.
Input will terminate with two 0 s.

### Output

For each test case, output a single integer on its own line, indicating the
count of Unhappy Numbers between lo and hi (inclusive). Output no
extra spaces, and do not separate answers with blank lines.

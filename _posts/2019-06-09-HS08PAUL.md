### **Statement**

In number theory there is a very deep unsolved conjecture of the Hungarian
Paul Erdős (1913-1996), that there exist infinitely many primes of the form
_x_ <sup>2</sup>+1, where _x_ is an integer. However, a weaker form of
this conjecture has been proved: there are infinitely many primes of the form
_x_ <sup>2</sup>+ _y_ <sup>4</sup>. You don't need to prove this, it
is only your task to find the number of (positive) primes not larger than _n_
which are of the form _x_ <sup>2</sup>+ _y_ <sup>4</sup> (where _x_
and _y_ are integers).

### Input

An integer _T_ , denoting the number of testcases ( _T_ ≤10000). Each of the
_T_ following lines contains a positive integer _n_ , where _n_ <10000000.

### Output

Output the answer for each _n_.

### **Statement**

On a sunny day, Stjepan and Bobert were arguing over their problem solving
skill under a big apple tree. Bobert brought up a nice problem he had just
recently solved and claimed that Stjepan could not solve it. Stjepan is
desperate and needs your help. Here is Bobert's problem:

Given an array of N (1  <= N <= 10^5) numbers (0 <= ai <= 10^9) and
K (1  <= K <= 20) sticks of a certain length Li (0  <= Li <= N, such
that the sum of all lengths is equal to N), find the best possible
distribution of the sticks among the array such that:

1) a stick of length L<sub>x</sub> can cover any interval of the array
whose length is equal to the length of the stick (it can cover
L<sub>x</sub> consecutive numbers of the array)

2) all sticks must be used and can not overlap or leave the borders of the
array

3) the value of a stick of length L<sub>x</sub> covering the interval [lo,
hi] is equal to: L<sub>x</sub> * (max[lo, hi] - min[lo, hi])

Note that: max = largest element of the array inside the interval and min =
smallest element of the array inside the interval

4) the sum of all stick values must be as large as possible

Note: double-check your complexity

### Input

9

2 6 3 1 8 4 3 5 6

4

2 3 2 2

The first line contains an integer N.

The second line contains N numbers representing the array.

The third line contains an integer K.

The fourth line contains K numbers representing the stick lengths.

### Output

The only line should contain the solution - the maximum sum of stick values as
explained in the task.

### **Statement**

You've been invited to the "I-Love-Kd-trees'' annual con, but first, you have
to show them that you really know about great data structures, so they give
you an easy task!  
  
You are given a list of N numbers and Q queries, each query consist of
three integers: _k ,_ _i_  and _l_ ;let d be the k-th
smallest element until the index i (i.e. if the first i+1 elements were
sorted in non-descending way, d would be the element at index k - 1 ).
Then, the answer to each query is the index of the l-th occurrence of
d in the array. If there's no such index, the answer is -1. You have
to consider that all indexes are counted starting with 0.

### Input

Input consists of one test case.

The first line contains two integers, N ( 1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>) and
Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>).

The next line contains N possibly distinct integers a<sub>i</sub>
( -10<sup>9</sup> ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).

  
Then Q lines follow, each of those contains three integers _k_ ,
_i_ and _l_. (0  < k ≤ i < N, 1 ≤ l ≤ N).

### Output

  
For each query (in the same order as the input) output a single line with the
answer to that query.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
      
     10 6  
    2 6 7 1 8 1 2 3 2 6  
    2 4 2  
    2 6 3  
    1 4 1  
    1 4 2  
    3 4 2  
    3 3 2  
    
    Output:
      
     6  
    -1  
    3  
    5  
    9  
    9  
      
     Explanation of the first query:   
      
     The elements until index 4 are [2,6,7,1,8] so the 2nd smallest element is 2, and your asked for the index of it's 2nd ocurrency, so the answer is 6.

### **Statement**


    Johnny is a gambling addict. He entered a casino and started playing a game with the dealer. The game is as follows: the dealer deals a sequence of _N_ cards, each card containing a number _C[i]_ and asks Johnny how many pairs (  _j, k_ ) such that _j_  < _k_ and _C[j]_ + _C[k]_ = _X_. If Johnny answers correctly he wins, otherwise the dealer wins.
    
    
    
    
    ## Input Format         
    
    
    
    
     The first line of input contains an integer _T_ , the number of test cases. _T_ test cases follow, Each test case start with the value of 0 ≤ _X_ ≤ 2*10<sup>3</sup> followed by the number of cards 0 < _N_ ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> followed by _N_ numbers representing the numbers on the cards 0 ≤ _C[i]_ ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>.
    
    
    
    
    ## Output Format
    
    
    
    
    There should be _T_ lines, containing the following format.
    
    
    
    
    _k. S_
    
    
    
    
     Where _k_ is the test case number (starting at 1), a single period, a single space and _S_ representing the number of valid pairs (  _j_ , _k_ ) as described above.

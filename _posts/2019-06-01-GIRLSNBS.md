### **Statement**

There are G girl students and B boy students in a class that is about to
graduate. You need to arrange them in a single row for the graduation. To give
a better impression of diversity, you want to avoid having too many girls or
too many boys seating consecutively. You decided to arrange the students in
order to minimize the gender regularity. The gender regularity of an
arrangement is the maximum number of students of the same gender (all girls or
all boys) that appear consecutively. Given G and B, calculate the minimum
gender regularity among all possible arrangements.

### Input

Each test case is described using a single line. The line contains two
integers G and B representing the number of girls and boys in the class,
respectively (0 ≤ G, B ≤ 1000). The end of input is indicated with a line
containing the number −1 twice.

### Output

For each test case, output a single line with a single integer representing
the minimum gender regularity that an arrangement of G girls and B boys can
have.

### Example

    
    
    Input:   
     10 10  
    5 1  
    0 1000  
    -1 -1
      
    Output:   
     1  
    3  
    1000

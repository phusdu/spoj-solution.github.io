### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug just got an inovative idea (which might be a rival of
captcha): She made following function - F(a)=least significant 1-bit of a
(indexed from 1). She also made following recursive function
T(N)=F(N*(N-1))<sup>3</sup>+T(N-2) , where T(0)=0,T(1)=0.

Her idea is following- Instead of asking for captcha, she uses an opposite
method: She gives you even N and you have to answer T(N) \- if your
answer is correct, then you are definetly robot and you won't be let in.

As her good friend she asked you to program a checker for her.

### Input

The input begins with an integer 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> , number of
queries.

The next Q lines contains an even integer: 2 ≤ N ≤
2*10<sup>8</sup>

### Output

For each query, print T(N)

### Example Input

    
    
    5
    8
    4
    2
    20
    1000
    

### Example Output

    
    
    107
    35
    8
    310
    23988
    

### Little explanation

    
    
    F(2)=2
    F(12)=3
    F(30)=2
    F(56)=4
    F(90)=2
    F(132)=3
    F(182)=2
    F(240)=5
    F(306)=2
    F(380)=3

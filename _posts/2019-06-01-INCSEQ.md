### **Statement**

Given a sequence of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000) integers S<sub>1</sub>, ...,
S<sub>N</sub> (0 ≤ S<sub>i</sub> < 100,000), compute the number of
increasing subsequences of S with length K (1 ≤ K ≤ 50 and K ≤ N); that is,
the number of K-tuples i<sub>1</sub>, ..., i<sub>K</sub> such that 1 ≤
i<sub>1</sub> < ... < i<sub>K</sub> ≤ N and
S<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub> < ... < S<sub>i<sub>K</sub></sub>.

### Input

The first line contains the two integers N and K. The following N lines
contain the integers of the sequence in order.

### Output

Print a single integer representing the number of increasing subsequences of S
of length K, modulo 5,000,000.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4 3
    1
    2
    2
    10
    
    Output:
    2
    

The two 3-tuples are (1, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 4), both corresponding to the
subsequence 1, 2, 10.

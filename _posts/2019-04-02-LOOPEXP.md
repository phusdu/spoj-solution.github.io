### **Statement**

Consider the following pseudo-code

int a[1..N];

int max = -1;

for i = 1..N:

if(a[i] > max)

max = a[i];

Your task is to calculate the expected number of times the 'if' block of the
above pseudo-code executes. The array 'a' is a random permutation of numbers
from 1..N chosen uniformly at random.

### Input

First line contains t, the number of test cases. t lines follow, each
containing N, the number of elements in the array.

1<= t <= 100

1<= n <=100,000

### Output

For each test case, output a single decimal. Your answer should be within
10^-6 of the correct answer.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    
    
    2
    
    Output:
    
    
    
    
    1.5
    
    
    Explaination :
    
    
    for N=2, you can have the following two permutations: [1,2]  and [2,1] . 
    
    
    for the first case the if block gets executed 2 times and for the second one the if block gets executed 1 time. So the expected 
    
    
    value is (3)/2 = 1.5

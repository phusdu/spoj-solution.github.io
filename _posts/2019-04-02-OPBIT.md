### **Statement**

Operation bits - A new operation conducted by the secret team currently
working on a project on security enhancement. Mr.Abay, the team head, has
found a new pattern on the perfect squares. This can be used as a outer cover
for his project as its securing power is low. So he assign you this problem to
find the key based on the given conditions:

"An two adjacent perfect squares have their absolute difference as an odd
number except when a and b are equal. Your task is to find the key which is
deined as:

key(a,b) where a and b are perfect squares is ( ( AND( absolute difference
betwen every adjacent perfect squares in [a,b]) ) AND ( XOR( absolute
difference betwen every adjacent perfect squares in [a,b]) ) )"

Find the key for the given inputs :)

### Input

The input begins with a number T (1<=T<=1000) where T is the number of
testcases.

T lines follow

Each line has two numbers a and b (0 < a <= b <= 10^6)

It is assured that a and b are perfect squares.

### Output

For each test case print the corresponding key

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    
    
    1 4
    
    
    25 49
    
    
    Output:
    3
    
    
    0
    
    
    for test case 1 we have key=(3)&(3)=3

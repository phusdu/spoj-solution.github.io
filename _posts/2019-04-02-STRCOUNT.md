### **Statement**

Let f(n,k) is the number of length n binary strings for which the length of
the longest substring of ones is equal to k. You have to build a table of
these values.

### Input

None.

### Output

63 lines - the n-th of them consists of n+1 values: f(n,0) f(n,1) ... f(n,n).

### Example

    
    
    1 1
    1 2 1
    1 4 2 1
    1 7 5 2 1
    ...

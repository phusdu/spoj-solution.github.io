### **Statement**

You're given a sequence A of N non-negative integers. Answer Q queries, where
each query consists of two integers: a, b. The answer is number of pairs of
integers i and j that satisfy these three conditions:  
  
(1) 1 <= i <= j <= N

(2) a <= j-i+1 <= b

(3) all elements of A with indices from range [i, j] are mutually distinct.
(indexing starts with 1)

Constraints :  
  
1 <= N <= 8*10^5  
1 <= Q <= 2*10^5  
0 <= A[k] <= 10^6, for every integer k between 1 and N, inclusive  
  
1 <= a <= b <= N

### Input

First line of input contains integer N. Second line contains N integers
representing sequence A. Third line is integer Q, number of queries. Next Q
lines have 2 integers, a and b.

### Output

In the i-th line output the answer for i-th query.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     5  
    1 2 3 4 5  
    1  
    1 1  
      
     Output:  
      
     5  
      
     NOTE: IO is huge

### **Statement**

As any experienced programmer must know the famous problem of "Edit Distance",
however this problem is considered an “alternating chain” if you have
alternately made case sensitive.

Example: "AaAaAbB" "B" "a" "aBaCdEf"

Alternating chains are considered in our problem.

We only have one operation that is permitted in exchange for a lower or upper
case Latin letter.

Given a string giving the minimum number of changes to be considered an
alternating chain.

### Input

A string with no spaces line containing only uppercase and lowercase letters,
one for each line of maximum length 10^3 until end of file

### Output

For each line print the minimum number of changes to the chain is a "chain
alternately"

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    AaAaB
    ABaa
    a
    
    Output:
    0
    2
    0

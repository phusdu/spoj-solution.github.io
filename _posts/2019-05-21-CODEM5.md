### **Statement**

### You are given an array of weights of n objects and your task is to select
minimum number of objects whose sum of weights is exactly equals to some given
k.

### Input

Input:  
Line 1 - Number of test cases T(<=10) followed by 2 lines for each test case  
Line 2 - Number of objects n(<=20) and total weight k(<=10^4)  
Line 3 - weights(<=10^4) of n objects(each separated by space)

### Output

Minimum number of objects whose weights sums to k.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2  
     5 9  
    10 9 4 3 5  
    3 7  
    1 2 3
    
    Output:
    1  
     impossible  
      
     Explanation : For 1st case the two combinations are possible:  
    (9),(4,5) hence minimum no of objects is 1  
      
    For 2nd case there is no combination possible hence impossible.
    



#### **Solution**

### **Statement**

Rastas's has been given a number n. Being weak at mathematics, she has to
consider all the numbers from 1 to 2 _n_ \- 1  so as to become perfect in
calculations. (You can assume each number is consider as a soldier).

We define the strength of number _i_ as the number of set bits (bits equal to
1) in binary representation of number _i_.

If the greatest common divisor of numbers _a_ and _b_ is _gcd_ ( _a_ , _b_ ),

Rastas would like to calculate the function _S_ which is equal to:

As the friend of Rastas, it's your duty to calculate _S_ modulo  109 \+ 7.

### Input

The first line of the input contains the number of test cases, T. Each of
the next T lines contains an integer n , as mentioned in the question

### Output

For each value of n given, find the value of the function S.

### Constraints

Sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2500.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
     3 
    
    
    1 
    
    
    2 
    
    
    5

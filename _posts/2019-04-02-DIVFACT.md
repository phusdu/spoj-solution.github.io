### **Statement**

Given a number, find the total number of divisors of the factorial of the
number.

Since the answer can be very large, print answer modulo
10<sup>9</sup>+7.

### Input

The first line contains T, number of testcases.

T lines follows each containing the number N.

### Output

Print T lines of output each containing the answer.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    2
    3
    4
    
    Output:
    2
    4
    8
    

### Constraints

1 <= T <= 500

0 <= N <= 50000

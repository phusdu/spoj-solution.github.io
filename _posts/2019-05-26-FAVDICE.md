### **Statement**

BuggyD loves to carry his favorite die around. Perhaps you wonder why it's his
favorite? Well, his die is magical and can be transformed into an N-sided
unbiased die with the push of a button. Now BuggyD wants to learn more about
his die, so he raises a question:

What is the expected number of throws of his die while it has N sides so
that each number is rolled at least once?

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t , the number of test
cases. t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of a single line containing a single integer N (1
<= N <= 1000) - the number of sides on BuggyD's die.

### Output

For each test case, print one line containing the expected number of times
BuggyD needs to throw his N -sided die so that each number appears at
least once. The expected number must be accurate to 2 decimal digits.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    1
    12
    
    Output:
    1.00
    37.24

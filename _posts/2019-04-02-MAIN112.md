### **Statement**

For a sequence of N integers, A1, A2, ..... AN

We can calculate the stability factor P, as

P = sum of all (abs(A<sub>i</sub>-A<sub>i-1</sub>)*C[i]) where 2 <= i
<= N

C[i] is the cost of putting a number at position i

Your task is find the minimum P for the given N numbers considering all the
different permutations of them.

Input

First line contains an integer T(1<=T<=10) which denotes the total number of
test cases. Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line contains the integer N(1<=N<=15). The second line contains a
space separated list of N integers(<150) which denote the given set of
numbers.

The third line contains a space separated list of N integers. The ith integer
on this line denotes the value for C[i](1 <= C[i] < 150)

### Output

For each test case, print the minimum possible value of P considering all
permutations of the given numbers.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    5
    1 8 3 6 5
    1 2 3 4 5
    
    Output
    24
    

One of the possible permutation of given numbers which has p = 24 is 1, 3, 5,
6, 8

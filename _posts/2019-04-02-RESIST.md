### **Statement**

### Input

Multiple test cases. For each test case:

The first line contains integers N and M; N is a number of nodes in the
circuit (2 < N <= 100), M is the number of resistors (0 <= M <= 300). Each of
the next M lines consists of three integers A<sub>i</sub>,
B<sub>i</sub> and R<sub>i</sub> â€” description of a resistor that has
resistance R<sub>i</sub> connecting the nodes A<sub>i</sub> and
B<sub>i</sub> (1 <= A<sub>i</sub> , B<sub>i</sub> <= N; 1 <=
R<sub>i</sub> <= 100).

There's a blank line between consecutive test cases in the input file. No
other extra whitespace will/should be appear in the input/output.

Input terminates by EOF.

### Output

For each test case, output the total resistance between the nodes 1 and N
rounded within two digits after a decimal points. There won't be any test case
the output for which is +INF.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4 5
    1 2 15
    2 4 5
    1 3 10
    3 4 10
    2 3 1
    
    Output:
    9.40

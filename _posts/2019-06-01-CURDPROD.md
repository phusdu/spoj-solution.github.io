### **Statement**

A curd manufacturing factory owns curd producing machines of different
qualities. A curd producer of quality q produces 1 unit of curd in q units of
time.

  
For example, a curd producer of quality 5 produces 1 unit of curd at time 5, 1
unit of curd at time 10 and so on..

Given the qualities of all the machines, find the minimum time required to
produce T units of curd.

  

Input:

The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each
testcase, the first line consists of 2 integers n and T, the number of
machines and the target amount of curd. The next n lines consists of integers
representing the qualities of the producer machines.  
 

Output:

For each test case, find the minimum time required to produce the target
amount of curd.

  

Input Constraints :

1 <= t <= 10^2

1 <= n <= 10^4

1 <= T <= 10^9

1 <= quality of each machine <= 10^9

  

Note: Note that a quality 5 producer produces only 1 curd at time 9 and
not 1.8.

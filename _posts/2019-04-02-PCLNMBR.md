### **Statement**

Ajoy has got some spare time today. He is using this spare time to think of a
particular kind of number.

He calls it ‘Peculiar Number’.

A peculiar number is define by three integers A, B and C and has the following
characteristics.

1) If a number is a multiple of A but not a multiple of B then it is a
peculiar number.

2) If a number is a multiple of both A and B then it will be a peculiar number
only if it is also a multiple of number C. Otherwise it is not a peculiar
number.

Now, Ajoy is trying to find the Nth peculiar number for a fixed A, B and C.

But Ajoy does not have all day. So he needs your help to solve the problem.

### Input

First line of the input contains four integers A, B, C and M where (1 <= A, B,
C <= 10<sup>3</sup>) and (1 <= M <= 10<sup>5</sup>) contraints hold.

M denotes the number of queries.

Each of the next M line contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 10<sup>9</sup>).

### Output

For each query, print the Nth peculiar number.

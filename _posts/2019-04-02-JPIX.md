### **Statement**

![](http://www.spoj.com/content/john_jones:jpix1.jpg)

Shuffling the pixels in a bitmap image sometimes yields random looking images.
However, by repeating the shuffling enough times, one finally recovers the
original images. This should be no surprise, since "shuffling" means applying
a one-to-one mapping (or permutation) over the cells of the image, which come
in finite number.

Your program should read a number n , and a series of elementary
transformations that define a "shuffling"
![](http://www.spoj.com/content/john_jones:jpix6.png) of n * n images. Then,
your program should compute the minimal number m (m > 0) , such that m
applications of ![](http://www.spoj.com/content/john_jones:jpix6.png) always
yield the original n * n image.

For instance if ![](http://www.spoj.com/content/john_jones:jpix6.png) is
counter-clockwise 90<sup>o</sup> rotation then m = 4.

### Input

Test cases are given one after another, and a single 0 denotes the end of the
input. For each test case:

Input is made of two lines, the first line is number n (2 <= n <=
2<sup>10</sup> , n even). The number n is the size of images, one image is
represented internally by a n * n pixel matrix
(a<sup>j</sup><sub>i</sub>) , where i is the row number and j is the
column number. The pixel at the upper left corner is at row 0 and column 0.

The second line is a non-empty list of at most 32 words, separated by spaces.
Valid words are the keywords id , rot , sym , bhsym ,
bvsym , div and mix , or a keyword followed by -. Each keyword
key designates an elementary transform (as defined by Figure 1), and
key- designates the inverse of transform key. For instance, rot-
is the inverse of counter-clockwise 90<sup>o</sup> rotation, that is
clockwise 90<sup>o</sup> rotation. Finally, the list k<sub>1</sub>,
k<sub>2</sub>, ..., k<sub>p</sub> designates the compound transform
![](http://www.spoj.com/content/john_jones:jpix6.png) =
k<sub>1</sub>ok<sub>2</sub>o ... ok<sub>p</sub> . For instance,
"bvsym rot-" is the transform that first performs clockwise 90o rotation and
then vertical symmetry on the lower half of the image.

### Output

For each test case:

Your program should output a single line whose contents is the minimal number
m (m > 0) such that ![](http://www.spoj.com/content/john_jones:jpix6.png) is
the identity. You may assume that, for all test input, you have m <
2<sup>31</sup>.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    256
    rot- div rot div
    256
    bvsym div mix
    0
    
    Output:

### **Statement**

The King of DragonStone is known for his dragons and magic. It can be very
hardand dangerous to tame a dragon. So, in order to control his dragons The
King speaks random but powerful words. The strength of his words is determined
by a strange rule. Rule : Strength of a word is sum of cube of length of
palindromic substrings in the word. To recall the definition of palindrome,
palindrome is a word which reads same when read forward and backward. For
example, word "abaa" has 6 palindromic substrings. "aba","aa","a","b","a","a"
with sizes 3,2,1,1,1,1 respectively. Their cubes are 27,8,1,1,1,1. Hence total
strength is 39. Given a King's word, find its strength.

### Input

First line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Followed
by T lines, each line containing a word(say S).(only lowercase letters are
allowed).

Constraints:

1 <= length of word <= 1000

1 <= T <= 100

### Output

For every word (S), output a single line containing the strength of the word.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
    2 
    
    
    abaa 
    
    
    dbd 
    
    
     Output:
    
    39 
    
    30

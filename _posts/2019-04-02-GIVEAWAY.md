### **Statement**

You are given a 1-indexed array X , consisting of N integers, and
a set of Q queries. There are two kinds of queries:

  1. 0 a b c  
Here you are required to return the number of elements with indices in
[a,b]  
greater than or equal to c

  2. 1 a b  
Here you are required to change the a<sup>th</sup> element of array to
b.

### Input Format:

First line contains N , the number of elements in the array X. The
next line contains N space separated integers representing the elements of
X. The third line of input contains a single integer, Q , the number
of queries. The next Q lines of input each contain queries of two kinds as
described above.

### Output Format:

Q lines with the ith line contains the answer for the
i<sup>th</sup> query

### Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 5*10^5  
1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5  
1 ≤ X[i] ≤ 10^9  
1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ N for query type 0  
1 ≤ a ≤ 10^5, 1 < b ≤ 10^9 for query type 1  
1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9

### **Statement**

A positive integer is called a _palindrome_ if its representation in the
decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right to
left. For a given positive integer _K_ of not more than 1000000 digits, write
the value of the smallest palindrome larger than _K_ to output. Numbers are
always displayed without leading zeros.

### Input

The first line contains integer _t_ , the number of test cases. Integers _K_
are given in the next _t_ lines.

### Output

For each _K_ , output the smallest palindrome larger than _K_.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    808
    2133
    
    Output:
    818
    2222

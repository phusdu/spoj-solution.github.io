### **Statement**

You may have come across questions like, Match-The-Following words with their
synonyms in the second column and alike. Ted also stumbled upon one such
question. Being weak at english, he tried guessing the answers. While he
guessed, he thought about how unlucky he was at guessing.

Being also weak at math, he needs help from you for a slightly different task.
Find the total number of ways of completing the solution to this question in
which he gets none of the matches correct.

Note: In the match-the-following problem, there are two columns of words.
Each column contains N words. Words in the first column have to be matched
with words in the second column. A valid solution to this question requires
every word in the first column to be matched with only one word in the second
column and vice-versa.

### Input

First line contains a single integer T(1 <= T <= 1000) denoting the total
number of test cases. Each test case contains a single integer N (1 <= N <=
1000000).

### Output

For each test case, print a single integer the required number of ways modulo
1000000007

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    1
    2
    7
    
    
    
    Output:
    0
    1

### **Statement**

As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She grows cherry and
now she wants to collect them. She is wondering about the number of cherries
she will collect. But befor you could help here, you shall know some
biological facts:

Firstly, almost everyone think that cherry-tree is a tree. But it might not be
true - in fact, it is a graph.

Secondly, you have to know, how a cherry looks like. It is not hard to
recognize a chery - it is a node, which is connected to another two nodes,
which are NOT connected.

NOTE : Even though the cherry-tree structure might be weird, note that
there won't be any multi-branches nor self-branches. Anyway do not assume it
is not a cherry-forest.

This is a cherry:

![Cherry](../../content/morass:cherry.png)

This is NOT a cherry:

![Not a cherry](../../content/morass:notcherry.png)

### Input

The first line contains two integers 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> , the
number of nodes of cherry-tree and the number of branches (edges) connecting
them.

The next M lines contains two integers 0 ≤ a, b < N, the branch
connecting two nodes.

### Output

Print a single line - the number of cherries on the cherry-tree.

title:  LARSUBP - Large subsequence Problem
categories: ['tree', 'binary-search']
code: LARSUBP

### **Statement**

Given a string S which contains only digit-characters. How many
subsequences can be obtained from S such that every digit is strictly greater
than all previous digits in that subsequence.  
As for example if S=7598 then there are 8 subsequences which follow the above
constraint. These are 7,5,9,8,79,78,59,58. Notice that 7598 is not a required
subsequence because 7>5 and 9>8.

Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by
deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Input

Input starts with an integer T (â‰¤ 1000) , denoting the number of test
cases. Each case contains a string S. The length of S does not exceed
10000. S does not contain any leading zeros.

### Output

For each case, print the a string(without quotes) "Case i: " follwed by
number of subsequences where "i" is test case number. Answer may be very
large, so output it modulo 10^9+7.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     2  
    4  
    7598
    
    Output:
    Case 1: 1  
     Case 2: 8

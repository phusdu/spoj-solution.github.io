### **Statement**

You are given a tree with N nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1
to N. Each node has an integer weight.

We will ask you to perform the following operation:

  *u v k : ask for the kth minimum weight on the path from node u to node v

### Input

In the first line there are two integers N and M. ( N, M <=
100000)

In the second line there are N integers. The ith integer denotes the
weight of the ith node.

In the next N-1 lines, each line contains two integers u v , which
describes an edge ( u , v ).

In the next M lines, each line contains three integers u v k ,
which means an operation asking for the kth minimum weight on the path from
node u to node v.

### Output

For each operation, print its result.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    8 5
    105 2 9 3 8 5 7 7
    1 2
    1 3
    1 4
    3 5
    3 6
    3 7
    4 8  
     2 5 1  
    2 5 2  
    2 5 3  
    2 5 4  
    7 8 2 
    
    
    Output:
    2  
     8  
    9  
    105  
    7

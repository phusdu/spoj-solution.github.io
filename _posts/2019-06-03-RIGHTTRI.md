### **Statement**

[English](/problems/RIGHTTRI/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/RIGHTTRI/vn/)  
---|---  
  
  

N points are placed in the coordinate plane. Write a program which calculates
in how many ways a right triangle can be formed by three of the given points.
A right triangle is one in which one of the angles is 90 degrees.

# Input

The first line of input contains an integer N (3 <= N <= 1500), the number of
points. Each of the following N lines contains the coordinates of one point,
two integers separated by a space. The coordinates will be between -10^9 and
10^9. No two points will be located at the same coordinates.

# Output

    
    
    Output the number of right triangles. 
    
      
    
    
    ### Sample
    
      
    
    
    
    Sample input

    5   
    -1 1   
    -1 0   
    0 0   
    1 0   
    1 1   
       
    output   
       
    7   
      
    input

    5 0   
    2 6   
    8 6   
    5 7   
       
    output

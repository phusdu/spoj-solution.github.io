### **Statement**

Marina is a college girl who likes to play with all kinds of numbers. One day
she was very bored and decided to play around with even numbers.

She notes N numbers on the board(odd and even numbers) and then, she modifies
only even numbers (for some reason she likes the odd numbers) and inverts its
binary representation and replaces each even number. But soon she gets bored
and ask you help in order to automate the conversion process.

Marina is a college girl who likes to play with all kinds of numbers. One day
she was very bored and decided to play around with even numbers.

She writes N numbers on the board (odd and even numbers) and then, she
modifies only even numbers (for some reason she likes the odd numbers) and
reversed its binary representation (from the left to the right ) and replaces
each even number. But soon she gets bored and ask you help in order to
automate the conversion process.

### Input

In the first line contains the value of N. This integer is followed by N
lines, every one with a positive integer a<sub>i </sub>(1 <= a<sub>i
</sub><= 10^7).

### Output

The output will contain N lines, the numbers that are on the blackboard after
the conversion process.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    5
    10
    8
    3
    5
    2
    
    Output:
    5
    1
    3
    5
    1

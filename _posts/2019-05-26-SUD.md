### **Statement**

The name "Sudoku" is the Japanese abbreviation of a longer phrase, "suji wa
dokushin ni kagiru", meaning "the digits must occur only once". Sudoku is a
logic-based number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid so
that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 boxes contains the digits
from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid.

Unlike in magazines and newspapers, the digital representation of Sudoku a
puzzle is a string of length 81, with all rows of the puzzle placed one after
another. The representation uses ASCII symbols ‘1’-‘9’ for digits and ‘.’ for
an empty space. For example, the puzzle from figure above can be represented
as:

  
7..25..98..6....1....61.3..9....1.......8.4.9..75.28.1.94..3.......4923.61.....4.  

In this task you are to solve such puzzles automatically. The score will
depend on the number of solved puzzles and on the speed of your solution. Some
of the puzzles have multiple possible solutions, so be careful. A solution is
correct if it satisfies the given puzzle. You can be sure that all given
Sudokus are correct.

### Input

_t_ – the number of test cases; then _t_ test cases follows. [ _t_ <= 500]  
Each test case describes one SuDoku puzzle and consists of an 81-character-
long string.

### Output

For the i-th test case output a line containing Y if you want to solve the
test case or N if you wish to leave it out. If you chose to solve the test
case, in the next line output a sequence of exactly 81 characters
corresponding to the solution for the i-th Sudoku puzzle.

### Score

The score for this task calculated using the formula: _score =
200*total_solved/(200+time)_ , where _total_solved_ \- number of correctly
solved puzzles, _time_ \- running time of your program. If the score has the
following form: _xxx.xxxaaa_ , then _aaa_ \- is the number of correctly solved
puzzles.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    ..41..3.8.1....62...82..4.....3.28.9....7....7.16.8...562..17.3.3.....4.1....5...

    N
    
    Score:
    In this case _total_solved_ = 2. If the program runs for 10 seconds, 
    then the score of this solution will be equal to 1.905002

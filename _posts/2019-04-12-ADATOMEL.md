title:  ADATOMEL - Ada and Tomel
categories: ['uncategorized']
code: ADATOMEL
src: ADATOMEL.cpp

### **Statement**

As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She grows a tomel
[tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_\(data_structure\)). Tomel indeed is
a very specific tree. Its growing process starts with one root node with a
fruit of random flavor. Whenever a next branch grows, it begins to grow from a
random node which is already grown up. No growing starts until the branch is
fully grown. As a branch fully grows up, a node with fruit with random flavor
appears at the end of the branch.

As you surely haven't heard word random for a long time, Ada chooses three
random paths and wants to find the number of distinct flavors which grow on
the union of these three paths.

NOTE: Every random mentioned above is really meant to be random with equal
probability for each possible values.

### Input

The first line of input will contain three integers N, K, Q : 1 ≤ N, Q ≤
3*10<sup>5</sup>, 1 ≤ K ≤ 1000 , the number of nodes of tomel tree, the
universe of flavors and the number of Ada's questions.

The next line will contain N-1 integers 0 ≤ P<sub>i</sub> < i is
the parent of i<sup>th</sup> node (here i goes from 1 to
N-1 ).

The next line will contain N integers 1 ≤ F<sub>i</sub> ≤ K , the
flavor of each fruit.

The next Q lines will contain six integers 0 ≤ B, E, X, Y, L, R < N,
where the pairs of beginings/ends of the paths are: ( B, E ), ( X, Y
), ( L, R )

### Output

For each query output the number of distinct flavors which are on the three
paths.

### **Statement**

Fibonacci numbers are given by

  * f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

with f(0) = 0 & f(1) = 1.

first number of series ------ 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13

Now let's have a new series called "Fibonacci Twist" which is given by

  * ft(n) = ft(n-1) + ft(n-2) + (n-1) 

with ft(0) = 0 & ft(1) = 1.

with first few number in the series ----- 0 1 2 5 10 19 34 59

Now your task is to find ft(n).

Since the number can be Big you have to find the result mod M.

### Input

first line having single number 't' -- number of test cases.

next t lines have 2 number each 'n' and 'M'

### Output

Single number given the n-th term mod M

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    5 20
    10 77
    15 111
    
    Output:
    19
    45
    69

### Constraints

  * 10 <= t <= 100
  * 0 <= n <= 10^9
  * 100 <= M <= 10^9

### Explanation

  1. ft(5) is 19. 19 % 20 = 19
  2. ft(10) is 276. 276 % 77 = 45
  3. ft(15) is 3177. 3177 % 111 = 69

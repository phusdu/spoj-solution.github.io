### **Statement**

  

Problem Statement :

You and your friends are playing Game of Iron Thrones. In the Game of Iron
Thrones, you roll n dice together. You know that every die is a biased die.
You also know how biased the dice are on each face.

Find the probability that you will get at least K 6's when you roll all the n
dice at once.

Input :

The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each
test case, the first line consists of two integers n - the number of dice and
K - as defined above. The next n lines consists of 6 decimal numbers denoting
the probability of getting the corresponding face.

Output:

For each test case, find the probability to get at least K 6's when you roll
all the n dice at once. Your solution's absolute or relative error must be
strictly less than 10^-2. (i.e. your solution can make mistakes upto 0.01)

Input Constraints :

1 <= t <= 10^3

1 <= n <= 10^5

1 <= K <= 10^5

test case, the first line consists of two integers n - the number of dice and
K - as defined above. The next n lines consists of 6 decimal numbers denoting
the probability of getting the corresponding face. (face 1 to 6)

  

Output:

For each test case, find the probability to get at least K 6's when you roll
all the n dice at once. Your solution's absolute or relative error must be
strictly less than 10^-2. (i.e. your solution can make mistakes upto 0.01)

Explanation:

Case 1 : There are 6 dice and we need at least 6 sixes. The probability to
get 6 in all dice = 1*0.5*1*1*0.5*1 = 0.25.

Case 2: There are 3 dice and we need exactly one 6. No matter how many
times you throw the dice, you will always get atleast one 6.

Case 3 : There are 3 dice and we need at least two 6s. For the given
biased dice in which two of them never turns 6 the probability will be 0

Case 4 : Note that there can be more than K 6's. The probability in this
case would be 0.2*0.25 + 0.2 * (1-0.25) + (1-0.2) * 0.25 = 0.4

  

Note : Avoid cout for this problem as it will print the result in
scientific notation.

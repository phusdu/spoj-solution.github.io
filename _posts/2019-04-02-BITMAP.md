### **Statement**

There is given a rectangular bitmap of size _n*m_. Each pixel of the bitmap is
either white or black, but at least one is white. The pixel in _i_ -th line
and _j_ -th column is called the pixel ( _i,j_ ). The distance between two
pixels p<sub>1</sub> =( _i<sub>1</sub>,j<sub>1</sub>_ ) and
p<sub>2</sub> =( _i<sub>2</sub>,j<sub>2</sub>_ ) is defined
as:

d( p<sub>1</sub> , p<sub>2</sub> )=| _i<sub>1</sub>-
i<sub>2</sub>_ |+| _j<sub>1</sub>-j<sub>2</sub>_ |.

### Task

Write a program which:

  * reads the description of the bitmap from the standard input, 
  * for each pixel, computes the distance to the nearest white pixel, 
  * writes the results to the standard output. 

### Input

The number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases
follow separated by an empty line. In the first line of each test case there
is a pair of integer numbers _n, m_ separated by a single space, _1 <=n
<=182_, _1 <=m<=182_. In each of the following _n_ lines of the test case
exactly one zero-one word of length _m,_ the description of one line of the
bitmap, is written. On the _j_ -th position in the line ( _i+1_ ), _1 <= i <=
n_, _1 <= j <= m_, is '1' if, and only if the pixel ( _i,j_ ) is white.

### Output

In the _i_ -th line for each test case, _1 <=i<=n_, there should be written
_m_ integers f( _i,1_ ),...,f( _i,m_ ) separated by single spaces, where f(
_i,j_ ) is the distance from the pixel ( _i,j_ ) to the nearest white pixel.

### Example

    
    
    Sample input:
    1
    3 4
    0001
    0011
    0110
    
    Sample output:
    3 2 1 0
    2 1 0 0
    1 0 0 1

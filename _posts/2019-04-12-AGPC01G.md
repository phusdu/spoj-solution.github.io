### **Statement**

One of your friends was in relationship with multiple people at once and it
didn’t end very well. Thus he/she chose the path of righteousness and decided
to stay in only one relationship or stay single. But not only that, he/she
became a motivational speaker and formed an organization to help people to
walk through this path.

N people joined his/her organization. He/She takes one person and he/she
either pairs that person up with another person in a relationship or keeps
that person single. Let’s assume that every person can be paired up with every
other person. In how many ways he/she can do that?

### Input

First line of input will be T (1<= T <= 100000), denoting the number of test
cases.

Next T lines will contain one integer N (1<= N <= 100000) per line.

### Output

For each test case print correct answer describe in the description. As,
output can be large. Print it modulo 1000000007.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    3
    100000
    
    Output:
    4
    823421181
    

### Explanation

For case one, let’s assume they are numbered 1 2 and 3.

Formation can be:

{1} {2} {3} // every person is single

{1} {2, 3} // one is single and two other is in a relationship

{1, 2} {3} // one is single and two other is in a relationship

{1, 3} {2} // one is single and two other is in a relationship

Thus answer is 4.

### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug is cultivating vegetables. She has a long furrow full of
different kinds of it and she wants to know the number of unique vegetables on
a segment of the furrow. As the cultivation is a dynamic process, a kind (on a
single position) might become another kind during this process.

Given furrow and a few updates, can you answer questions asking about number
of unique kinds of vegetable on a segment?

### Input

The first line contains 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 2*10<sup>5</sup> , length of furrow
and number of queries.

Next line contains N integers 0 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤
2*10<sup>5</sup> , the kind of i<sup>th</sup> vegetable

Each of following Q lines contains one of the following kinds of query:

_1 I V_ : The vegetable on index 0 ≤ I < N, will be changed to kind 0 ≤
A ≤ 2*10<sup>5</sup>

_2 L R_ : 0 ≤ L ≤ R < N , the index of left/right bound of segment for
which you want to know the number of unique kinds.

### Output

For each query of second kind, print the number of unique kinds of vegetable.

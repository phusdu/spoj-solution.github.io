### **Statement**

Problem setter of INSOMNIA , MNNIT Allahabad decided to set a easy problem for
all coders so that they can easily solve the problem and boost their
confidence for rest of INSOMNIA.

The problem is a follows: You are given an array of size n while is
initialized with 0.You will be given q queries of two types

Type 1: set in (input value)index k to -1

Type 2: print the index which has value -1 and is greater or equal to input
index y

If there is no such value print -1

Note: Indexing is 1 based;

Type 2: print the index which has value -1 and is greater or equal to input

If there is no such value print -1

Note: Indexing is 1 based;

### Input

First line contains two integers n and q separated by spaces

Next q lines contains type of query and for type 1 query integer k separated
by a space and for type 2 integer y separated by a space;

1<=n<=10^6

1<=q<=10^6

1<=y,k<=n

### Output

Print a single line for each query type 2 containing index which has value -1
and is greater or equal to input index y

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    5 5
    
    
    2 3
    
    
    1 2
    
    
    2 1
    
    
    2 3
    
    
    2 2
    
    Output:
    -1
    
    
    2
    
    
    -1
    
    
    2

### **Statement**

Professor X has declared a fight against Magneto. He is gathering all his
X-Men. But he doesn’t want to risk anyone’s life. That’s why rather than
sending alone, he has decided to send each one of them in a group of 3
members. To select a group he is following a simple rule. A group will consist
of 3 members with same unit of power. The total power of each group will be
the product of all of their powers.

Now there are 3*N X-Men. Power of all the members of i th (1 <= i <=
N) group is i.

Given N , our task is to determine what will be sum of powers for all
group. Sum can be very large that’s why you need to print the square root of
sum.

### Input

First line of input is T (1 <= T <= 10000). Next T lines will contain an
integer N (1 <= N <= 1000000000).

### Output

For each case there will be a single number which is the square root for sum
of N groups’ total power. Output should be rounded to 3 digits after
decimal point.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    2
    
    Output:
    3.000

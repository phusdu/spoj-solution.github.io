title:  ADABERRY - Ada and Mulberry
categories: ['datastructures']
code: ADABERRY
src: ADABERRY.cpp

### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug grows a mulberry
[tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_\(data_structure\)) (which is rooted
at node 0). At the beginning, it has a mulberry fruit of distinct size growing
on every node. As the time flows, new mulberry fruits appear on each node
(additionally - meaning the previous mulberry fruit still remains on given
node) - while keeping the condition of distinct sizes.

Ada observes every single fruit and for each new fruit she is asking you to
tell her the number of lesser fruits in the subtree of given node.

### Input

The first line contains two integers 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 2*10<sup>5</sup> ,
size of mulberry tree.

The next line contains N integers: 0 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤
10<sup>6</sup> , the size of mulberry fruit in each node.

Each of the next N-1 lines contains two integers 0 ≤ a, b < N, meaning
the branch (edge) between given nodes.

Each of the next Q lines contains two integers a S : 0 ≤ a < N
(the node in which new fruit grows) and 0 ≤ S ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> (size
of the fruit)

### Output

For each query, print the number of lesser mulberry fruits which grow in
subtree of node where new mulberry fruit grew.

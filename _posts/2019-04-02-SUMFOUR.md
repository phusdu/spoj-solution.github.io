title:  SUMFOUR - 4 values whose sum is 0
categories: ['binary-search']
code: SUMFOUR
src: SUMFOUR.cpp
---

### **Statement**

The SUM problem can be formulated as follows: given four lists A, B, C, D of
integer values, compute how many quadruplet (a, b, c, d ) belongs to A x B x C
x D are such that a + b + c + d = 0 . In the following, we assume that all
lists have the same size n

### Input

The first line of the input file contains the size of the lists n (this value
can be as large as 4000). We then have n lines containing four integer values
(with absolute value as large as 2<sup>28</sup> ) that belong respectively
to A, B, C and D .

( Edited: n <= 2500)

### Output

Output should be printed on a single line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    6
    -45 22 42 -16
    -41 -27 56 30
    -36 53 -37 77
    -36 30 -75 -46
    26 -38 -10 62
    -32 -54 -6 45
    Output:
    5

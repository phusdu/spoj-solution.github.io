### **Statement**

In this hot summer AIUB students decided to go on a trip to Cox’s Bazaar sea
beach. Every student has some amount of money to spend in this trip. Each
student belongs to some group. If student A knows student B, B knows C then A,
B and C belong to the same group. In order to utilize the budget properly
students hired a travel agency to get an optimal travel plan. They submitted
the information about all the student’s money and relations among them. Now
the agency wants to figure out the number of groups and the total budget of
each group. Total budget of a group is the summation of all the student’s
money in that group.

### Input

The first line contains an integer T (1<=T<=50), denoting the number of test
cases.

Each case starts with two integers N M. N (1<=N<=1000), denotes the number of
students and M (0<=M<=(N*(N-1)/2)), denotes the number of relationships. In
the next line N integers are given. The ith (1<=i<=N) integer
a<sub>i</sub> (1<=a<sub>i</sub><=100) denotes the money ith student
has. Next M lines each contains two integers u v, (1<=u,v<=N and u != v)
denoting that u knows v and vice versa.

### Output

For each test case output “Case X: K” where X is the case number starting from
1 and K is the number of groups. In the next line output K integers, the total
budget of all the groups in ascending order of budget.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    5 3
    5 7 4 6 8
    1 2
    1 3
    4 5
    
    Output:
    Case 1: 2
    14 16

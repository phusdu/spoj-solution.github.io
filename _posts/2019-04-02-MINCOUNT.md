### **Statement**

A triangle made of coins of height h is as follows  
It has h coins at the base and h-1 coins one level above base and so on.(Coins
are placed as shown in the figure below)  
And at the top most level there will be only one coin  
Now given h the task is to invert this triangle by moving minimum number of
coins. For example when h=4 triangle is  
![Invert](/content/abhilash_i:invert)  
For h=4 at least 3 coins must be moved to invert it.  

### Input

In the first line N will be given and then N lines follow with each line
having a integer which is the height of triangle in that test
case.00â‰¤h<10<sup>10</sup>;

### Output

For each test case output in a seperate line the minimum number of moves
required to invert the triangle. Output fits in long long data type

### Example

    
    
    Inputt:
    1
    3
    
    Output:
    2

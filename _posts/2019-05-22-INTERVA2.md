### **Statement**

Give you N ( 1 <= N <= 200000 ) intervals, represented as [A, B], for example
, interval s represented as [As,Bs].

For two intervals s and t, we say S covered by T if At <= As and Bs <= Bt. Now
my problem is easy, just tell me the question below: For each interval, how
many intervals can cover it but not covered by it ?

### Input

The input contains multiple test cases.  
For each test case, the first line is an integer N ( 1 <= N <= 200000 ), which
is the number of intervals. Then come N lines, the i-th of which contains two
integers: A<sub>i</sub> and Bi ( A<sub>i </sub>, B<sub>i
</sub>will not exceed the 32-bit integer) specifying the two parameters
described above.

### Output

For each test case, output one line containing n space-separated integers, the
i-th of which specifying the number of intervals that can cover it but not
covered by it.

### Example

    
    
    Input
    
     3
    
    0 1
    
    -1 2
    
    -2 3
    
    Â 
    
    2
    
    0 1
    
    0 1
    
     Output:  
    
    
     2 1 0
    
    0 0

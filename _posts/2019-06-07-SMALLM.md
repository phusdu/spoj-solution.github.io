code: SMALLM

### **Statement**

60 is divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 5. No smaller number than 60 have this
property.

### Input

On the first line, you will be given two integers _T_ (the number of test
cases), and _M_ (an integer). Each of the next _T_ lines contains an integer
_N_.

### Output

For each test case, output on one line, the smallest number that is divisible
by all integers from 1 to _N_ (inclusive). As the answer may be a big number,
output it modulo _M_.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1 1000000007
    5
    Output:
    60
    

### Constraints

    
    
    T <= 10^5
    10^8 <= M <= 2Ã—10^9, a prime number
    0 < N < 10^8
    

### Information

There's one easy input file, and several harder ones. Time limit allows
unoptimized code with fast languages to get AC ; for slower languages it may
be hard. Good luck and have fun ;-)

Edit(2017-02-11) : New time limit (after compiler changes).

### **Statement**

Given a number , output how many digits in number that number
itself is divisible by. Count all occurences of such digits in the number, not

must be 3.

### Input

Each test case is a number between 1 and 10<sup>240</sup>.

### Output

for each test case, output how many of its digits divide the number.

### Example

     12345  
    661232  
    312

### **Statement**

You will be given an array A. You can pick X (where X is a prime )
consecutive elements from the array A so that the sum is maximized. Note that
you can select multiple consecutive elements.

For example, if you are given an array with 10 elements, then one of ways you
can select elements by selecting 1<sup>st</sup>,2<sup>nd</sup> element
then 4<sup>th</sup>,5<sup>th</sup>,6<sup>th</sup> element then
8<sup>th</sup>,9<sup>th</sup> elements.

Another way can be to select 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> element
then select 4-10 elements.

### Input

The first line of the input will be an integer t, denoting the number of
the test cases.

For each test case, there will be an integer n , denoting the size of the
array A.

Next line there will be n integers denoting the elements of the array A.

### Output

For each test case, print the maximized sum (as discussed above) in a line.

Constraints:

1 <= t <= 100

1 <= n <= 2000

1 <= elements of the array A <= 100000

### Sample

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     2
    
    4
    
    1 2 3 4
    
    10
    
    10 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2
    
    
    Output:
    
    
     9
    
    21

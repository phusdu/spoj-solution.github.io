### **Statement**

Ankur sir is really obsessed with dce coders. Every other day he announces to
the admins the current number of members and boasts about the continuos
increase in the member count. Within a week the admins got bored of his habit
and started losing interest in this topic. Ankur sir is very clever. He knows
that every body loves to solve puzzles. To maintain their interest he decides
to ask a puzzle based on the number of current members. This way he can still
bug the admins about the increasing member count without making them feel
bored. The puzzle says for the given member count N, tell me how how many
smaller numbers (k>=2) exist such that F(k)=2*k*k-1 is a prime.

### Input

First line gives T, the number of test cases

Each of the next T lines give a number N.

### Output

Print the output for every test case on a new line

### Constraints

T<=1000

2<=N<=10000000

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    5

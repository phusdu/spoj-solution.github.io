### **Statement**

Even though there is almost half a year before Ada the Ladybug's birthday, her
friend already started searching for a birthday gift. As Ada is a
mathematician, they decided to give her a number. They know that Ada loves
numbers, which are composed by concatenation of prime numbers (at least one).

Sometime there are multiple ways to do so: for example 37 can be concatenation
of "3" and "7", yet it can also be concatenation of "37" itself. The more
ways, the better the number is. Ada's friends want to surprise her by as good
number as possible so they want you to write a program, which could count the
number of ways.

NOTE: Number with leading zeroes is a valid number (treat it as if the
leading zeroes are not there)

### Input

The first line contains an integer 1 ≤ T ≤ 100

Each of the next N lines contains a number 1 ≤ A < 10<sup>30</sup>

### Output

For each number, print the number of ways it can be written as concatenation
of prime numbers.

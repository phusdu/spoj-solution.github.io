title:  UPDATEIT - Update the array !
categories: ['bitmasks']
code: UPDATEIT

### **Statement**

You have an array containing n elements initially all 0. You need to do a
number of update operations on it. In each update you specify l, r and val
which are the starting index, ending index and value to be added. After each
update, you add the 'val' to all elements from index l to r. After 'u' updates
are over, there will be q queries each containing an index for which you have
to print the element at that index.

### Input

First line consists of t, the number of test cases. (1 <= t <= 10)

Each test case consists of "n u",number of elements in the array and the
number of update operations, in the first line (1 <= n <= 10000 and 1 <= u <=
100000)

Then follow u lines each of the format "l r val" (0 <= l,r < n, 0 <= val
<=10000)

Next line contains q, the number of queries. (1 <= q <= 10000)

Next q lines contain an index (0 <= index < n)

### Output

For each test case, output the answers to the corresponding queries in
separate lines.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1  
     5 3  
    0 1 7  
    2 4 6  
    1 3 2  
    3  
    0  
    3  
    4  
       
    Output:  
     7  
    8  
    6

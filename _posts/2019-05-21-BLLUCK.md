Toriel is planning to create a game with prize. In this game, there are N
players and N boxes each containing a piece of paper with a player's name
written on it. Each player has a unique name and each box contains a different
name. There are at most 1000 players playing.

Then, each player take 1 box at random such that every player got a different
box. The more player got a box containing their name, the bigger the prize is.
To prepare the prize, Toriel needs your help to calculate the expected number
of player to get their own name.

### Input.

each game.

### Output

For each game, output the expected number of players to get the box containing
their own name. Output exactly 6 digits after decimal points.

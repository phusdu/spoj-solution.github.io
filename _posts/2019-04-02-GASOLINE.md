### **Statement**

  

Problem Statement :

A pizza delivery company has to find the number of units of gasoline required
in the motor bike to deliver a pizza.

The company owner gives you a map which contains the locations and the
connecting roads. (vertices and edges). You are also given the length of each
road. For each unit distance, 1 unit of gasoline is required. The owner
neither has the delivery location of the pizza nor the location of the stores.

Now the company owner asks you "What is the minimum amount of Gasoline needed
in a motor bike to deliver one pizza order?". Can you answer him?

Input :

The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each
test case, the first line consists of an integer n denoting the number of
roads. For each road, you are given 3 integers a,b and l denoting the edges
that connects two locations a and b with length l.

Output:

For each test case, find the minimum amount of gasoline needed in order to
deliver one pizza order. If it is impossible to deliver the order, print -1.

Input Constraints :

1 <= t <= 10^3

Problem Statement :

![](http://www.spoj.com/content/cegprakash:gasoline.png)

A pizza delivery company owner gives you a map which contains n locations and
m connecting roads. (vertices and edges). The locations are numbered from 0 to
n-1. You are also given the length of each road. To travel, one unit distance,
the motor bike needs 1 unit of gasoline. The company owner neither has the
delivery location of the pizza nor the location of the stores.

Now the company owner asks you "What is the minimum amount of Gasoline needed
in a motor bike to deliver one pizza order?". Can you answer him?

  

Input :

The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each
test case, the first line consists of two integers n and m denoting the number
of locations and roads respectively. The next m lines consists of 3 integers
a,b and l denoting the road that connects two locations a and b with length l.

  

Output:

For each test case, find the minimum amount of gasoline needed in order to
deliver one pizza order. If it is impossible to deliver the order, print
-1.

  

Input Constraints :

1 <= t <= 50

1 <= n <= 500

0 <= m <= 500

a != b

1 <= l <= 100

  

Time limit :

20 seconds

Explanation :

For the given test case, 24 units of gasoline is sufficient to deliver a pizza
regardless of the store location and delivery location.

  

Note : There can be more than one road between a pair of locations.

### **Statement**

Prime( n ) is defined as number of primes less than equal to n.

Totient( n ) is defined as the number of positive integers less than or
equal to n that are relatively prime to n.

F( n ) = Prime( n ) – Totient( n )

and we don’t like negative values, so if F( n ) < 0, consider it as 0.

G(n) = Totient( n ) ^ (Factorial (F( n )))

You are given a number n. You have to output G( n ) % 10^9+7.

### Input

First line consists of T , the number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines contains one integer n.

### Output

Output T lines each line containing the value of function G( n ) %
10^9+7

### Constraints

1<= T <=100

1<= n <=10000000

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1

categories: ['hash-table', 'hashing']
code: HASHIT
src: HASHIT.cpp

### **Statement**

Your task is to calculate the result of the hashing process in a table of 101
elements, containing keys that are strings of length at most 15 letters (ASCII
codes ' _A_ ',...,' _z_ '). Implement the following operations:

  * find the index of the element defined by the key (ignore, if no such element), 
  * insert a new key into the table (ignore insertion of the key that already exists), 
  * delete a key from the table (without moving the others), by marking the position in table as _empty_ (ignore non-existing keys in the table) 

When performing find, insert and delete operations define the following
function:  
_integer Hash(string key)_ ,  
which for a string _key_ = _a_ <sub>1</sub>... _a<sub>n</sub>_ returns
the value:  
_Hash_ ( _key_ )= _h_ ( _key_ ) mod 101, where  
_h_ ( _key_ )=19 *(ASCII( _a_ <sub>1</sub>)*1+...+ASCII(
_a<sub>n</sub>_ )* _n_ ).  
Resolve collisions using the open addressing method, i.e. try to insert the
key into the table at the first free position: ( _Hash_ ( _key_ )+ _j_
<sup>2</sup>+23* _j_ ) mod 101, for _j_ =1,...,19. After examining of at
least 20 table entries, we assume that the insert operation cannot be
performed.

### Input

  
_t_ [the number of test cases  <= 100]  
_n_ <sub>1</sub> [the number of operations (one per line)[<= 1000]  
ADD:string  
[or]  
DEL:string [other test cases, without empty lines betwee series]

### Output

For every test case you have to create a new table, insert or delete keys, and
write to the output:  
the number of keys in the table [first line]  
index:key [sorted by indices]

### **Statement**

\------------------------  
I take this problem from my midterm exam today, because for me and some of my
friends it's interesting, so I decided to translated this problem into english
and upload this problem to SPOJ. See the original problem in indonesian
language
[here](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hDQcB4cjLZQ/UKPlwjMSDeI/AAAAAAAAAPA/ZF-
EdjfCKyA/s1600/2012-11-14+23.41.39.jpg "Ori").  
\------------------------

Given N sectors where 1 < N <10<sup>1000</sup>, from a circle that
sown in the picture below:

![circle](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xmt-
ef5JnZA/UKPNsaeXZZI/AAAAAAAAAOY/n3UcOwaAFY4/s1600/circle.png)

We will color each sector with K different colors, where 2 < K
<10<sup>1000</sup> such that each sector colored with one color and each
adjacent sector must have different color. Your task is to count how many ways
to color all that sectors.

### Input

First line, there is a number T (0< T <1000) denoting number of test
cases, then T lines follow.  
each line containing two integers: N and K separated by a space.

### Output

For each test case, output number of ways to color the circle, since the
number can be too large, take modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    
    
    2 3
    
    
    3 3
    
    Output:
    6
    
    
    6

### Explanation:

For the first case, we have two sectors and three colors, here is all
possibilities:

![2 sectors 3
colors](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NRBt3XOR3M8/UKPWpTfG0PI/AAAAAAAAAOo/4BgU7EwAP7E/s1600/2sec.png)

For second test case, we have three sector and three colors, here is all
possibilities:

![3 sectors 3
colors](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qrB8RitZXk8/UKPWrFtPUaI/AAAAAAAAAOw/B0qOl_SFpqA/s1600/3sec.png)

Time limit set so that ~128 Bytes of python 3 code can get accepted, also my
C top speed program AC in 0.12s  
Have fun :)

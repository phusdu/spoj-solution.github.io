### **Statement**

Orianna is a great swimmer and she's going to a swimming competition this
month and needs your help as she is highly paranoic about the results of the
competition.

The competition consists in some sort of evaluations, every judge makes a
score and, based on that score and the score of other contestants she will get
a score belonging to her results, those scores are final, meaning that will
not change in the competition.

Orianna requires this solution with urgency, she is getting evaluated on a lot
of ways and she is very worried about her results, so she wants to know what
is the worst score from an evaluation A to other evaluation B inclusive.

### Input

The first line of the test data will start with an integer T representing the
T test cases, then, T cases will follow, each of the cases starts with two
integers N and Q, denoting the number of evaluations Orianna had, then, N
integers will follow denoting the score on each evaluation, after that, Q
queries will begin, each query consist on two integers A and B.

### Output

You must output the string “`Scenario #i:`“, a blank line and then the result
of each query, remember, Orianna is interested on the worst score from
evaluation A to evaluation B inclusive.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    5 3
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 5
    1 3
    2 4
    5 3
    1 -2 -4 3 -5
    1 5
    1 3
    2 4
    
    Output:
    Scenario #1:
    1
    1
    2
    Scenario #2:
    -5
    -4
    -4

### Constraints

  * 1 <= T <= 100

Small input (30%):

  * 1  <= N <= 1,000
  * 1 <= Q <= 1,000
  * -10^9 <= Ni <= 10^9
  * 1 <= A <= B <= N

Large input (70%):

  * 1 <= N <= 100,000
  * 1 <= Q <= 100,000
  * -10^9 <= Ni <= 10^9
  * 1 <= A <= B <= N

Solutions rejudged due to weak test cases.

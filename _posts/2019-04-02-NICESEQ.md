### **Statement**

A nice sequence is a sequence of digits in which a digit d is placed at any
index iff d is 0 or any divisor of d(except 1) has been placed already. First
digit can be anything from 1 to 9.

Find the number of nice sequences of length n.

Find the number of nice sequences of length n.

Input

Input consists of number of test cases t  
Following t lines have a single line containing n as described in the problem
statement.

Output

Print the number of nice sequences of length n modulo 1000000007 in a seperate
line .

### Example

    
    
    Input:

     Explaination :
    For n=2 nice sequences are :
    
    
    10,20,22,24,26,28,30,33,36,39,40,44,48 and so on !
    
    
    
    Constraints:
    
    
    1<=n<=1000

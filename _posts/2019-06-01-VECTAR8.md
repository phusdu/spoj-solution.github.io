### **Statement**

Changu and Mangu are afraid of prime numbers, but they are not afraid of all
prime numbers. They were afraid of only a special kind of prime numbers. They
are afraid of the prime numbers (without the digit zero, they love all the
primes which have digits 0 in them) that remain prime no matter how many of
the leading digits are omitted. For example, they are afraid of 4632647
because it doesn't have the digit 0 and each of its truncations (632647,
32647, 2647, 647, 47, and 7) are primes.

You are given a simple task, given a number of N, find out the number of
primes not greater that N, that changu and mangu are afraid of.

### Input

The first line contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each
containing a number N.

### Output

On each line print the number of primes not greater that N, that changu and
mangu are afraid of.

### **Statement**

Little Tulip recently learnt about how to write numbers. So she wrote some
numbers in a paper in a line. But she never wrote a number which is less than
the prevous one.

Now she want to know how many different numbers are in a given range.

In short, you are given an array of N integers indexed from 1 to N, and q
queries, each in the form i j, you have to find the number of distinct
integers from index i to j (inclusive).

### Input

Input starts with an integer T (≤ 15), denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of a case is a blank line. The next line contains two integers
N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5). The next line contains N space separated
positive integers forming the array. Each of the next q lines will contain a
query which is in the form i j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N).

### Output

For each test case, print the case number in a single line. Then for each
query you have to print a line containing number of distinct integers from
index i to j.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    
    5 3
    1 2 2 4 5
    1 2
    1 5
    4 5
    
    3 1
    1 1 1
    1 3
    
    
    Output:
    Case 1:
    2
    4
    2
    Case 2:
    1

### **Statement**

Given 3 three pegs: leftmost peg A, middle peg B and rightmost peg C.Find the
shortest sequence of moves that transfers a tower of n disks from the left peg
A to the right peg C, if direct moves between A and C are disallowed. (Each
move must be to or from the middle peg B.)  
  
Constraints:  
1\. Initially the left peg A in stacked by n disks in the order of decreasing
size.  
2\. Only one move cand be done at a time and never moving a larger one onto a
smaller.  
3\. Number of moves will always be less than 2^64.  
4\. 1 <= n <= 35

### Input

Input begins with a integer t, followed by t lines. Each line has the no. of
pegs n.

### Output

For each test case, output the minimum no. of move required to transfer the n
disks from peg A to peg C.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     4  
    1  
    2  
    5  
    10  
      
     Output:

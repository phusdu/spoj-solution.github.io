### **Statement**

Leeana Learned Few New Things Few Days Ago , Like:

1) Find The Summation Of Divisors.

2) Modular Arithmetic

So Now Her Uncle Gave Her A Task.

Task Is: You Will Be Given A Number(N) And Another Number(K). Now You Have
To Find K<sub>th</sub> Power Summation Of Divisors Of N.

Summation Of All Divisors Of N Will Be Huge, So You Have To Print The
Summation Module (M=1000000007).

Like: Divisors Of 6 is: ( 1 2 3 6 ) And K = 2.  
so, summation is: 1^K+2^K+3^K+6^K = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2= 1+4+9+36 =
50%1000000007=50

Leeana Thinks That You Are A Great Programmer, So She Needs Your Help. Can
You Help Her??? :D :D :D

### Input

Input Starts With An Integer T (≤ 500), Denoting The Number Of Test Cases.
Each Case Contains An Integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>15</sup>) And An Integer K
(1 ≤ K ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>) Denoting The Power Of Divisors.

### Output

For Each Test Cases, Print The Case Number And The Kth Power Summation Of
Divisors Of N Module 1000000007. After Each Case Print A New Line. See Sample
Input And Output For Better Explanation.

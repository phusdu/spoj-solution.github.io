### **Statement**

This is a problem of Euclidean Geometry. See the figure below.

![](/content/frankr:ff)

Your task is as follows: given the lengths of segments b, c, and d, calculate
the length of segment a.

### Input

The input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t<=300). In
each of the next t lines there are three integers b, c and d (0 <= b, c and d
<= 10<sup>200</sup> ; b,d < c) separated by a space.

### Output

For every test case print the length of the segment a, one number per line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    3 8 5
    10 18 12
    
    Output:

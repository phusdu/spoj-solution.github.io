### **Statement**

Certain positive integers have their decimal representation consisting only of
ones and zeros, and having at least one digit one, e.g. 101. If a positive
integer does not have such a property, one can try to multiply it by some
positive integer to find out whether the product has this property.

### Input

Number _K_ of test cases ( _K_ is approximately 1000);  
in each of the next _K_ lines there is one integer _n_ ( _1 <= n <= 20000)_  

### Output

For each test case, your program should compute the smallest multiple of the
number _n_ consisting only of digits 1 and 0 (beginning with 1).

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    17
    11011
    17
    Output:
    11101
    11011
    11101

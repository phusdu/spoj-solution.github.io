### **Statement**

k bandits robbed a bank. They took away n gold coins. Being a
progressive group of robbers they decided to use the following procedure to
divide the coins. First the most respected bandit takes 1 coin, then the
second respected takes 2 coins, ..., the least respected takes k
coins, then again the most respected takes k+1 coins, ans so on, until one
of the bandits takes the remaining coins. Calculate how much gold each of the
bandits gets.

### Input

The first line of the input contains number t â€“ the amount of tests. Then
t test descriptions follow. Each test consists of two integers n and
k \- the amount of coins and bandits respectively.

### Constraints

1  <= t <= 500  
10<sup>6</sup> <= n <= 10<sup>15</sup>  
2 <= k <= 100

### Output

For each test print the amounts of coins each bandit gets separated by spaces.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    1000000 2
    1234567 3
    123456789 4
    
    Output:
    499849 500151
    411602 411887 411078
    30869901 30858368 30862296 30866224

### **Statement**

You are given n numbers a1, a2, , , an. You have to permute the numbers in
such a way that resulting permutation should be lexicographically smallest .
But there is a problem, you can not swap every pair of numbers. You can only
swap the position i and j if they are good position. You will be given m pairs
of i and j's which will denote good positions.

So complying to restrictions posed here, find the lexicographically smallest
permutation of a1, a2, , , an.

Definition: (a1, a2. ... an) is lexicographically smaller than (b1, b2. .. bn)
if first index i where ai and bi differs, ai < bi satisfies.

eg. (1, 2, 3, 4) is smaller than (2, 1, 3, 4)

### Input

T : number of test cases (T <= 10)

Next Line will contain n and m. (1 <= n <= 10^3 and 0 <= m <= min (n * (n - 1)
/ 2, 10^5).

Next Line will contains a1, a2, , , an. (a[i] >= 1 && a[i] <=10^6)

For next m lines, each line will contain i, j seperated by space which will
denote that you can swap ai and aj.

### Output

For each test case, output n numbers representing the permutation of a1, a2, ,
, an according to problem statement.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2  
     3 1  
    3 2 1  
    2 3  
    4 2  
    2 4 3 1  
    1 3  
    3 4  
     Output:
    3 1 2  
     1 4 2 3

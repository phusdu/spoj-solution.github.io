### **Statement**

Given a positive odd integer K and two positive integers low and high,
determine how many integers between low and high contain exactly K divisors.

### Input

The first line of the input contains a positive integer C (0 < C < 100,000),
the number of test cases to follow. Each case consists of a line containing
three integers: K, low, and high (1 < K < 10000, 0 < low â‰¤ high < 10^10). K
will always be an odd integer.

### Output

Output for each case consists of one line: the number of integers between low
and high, inclusive, that contain exactly K divisors.

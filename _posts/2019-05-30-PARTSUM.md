### **Statement**

Given a sequence of positive integers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>,
..., a<sub>N</sub>, and 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N, the partial sum from  
i to j is a<sub>i</sub> + a<sub>i+1</sub> + ... + a<sub>j</sub>.

In this problem, you will be given such a sequence and two integers P and K.
Your task is to find the smallest partial sum modulo P that is at least K.

For example, consider the following sequence of integers:

    
    
    12     13     15     11     16     26     11

Here N = 7. Suppose K = 2 and P = 17. Then, the answer is 2 because 11 + 16 +
26 = 53 and 53 mod 17 is 2. On the other hand, if K = 0 the answer is 0 since
15 + 11 + 16 + 26 = 68 and 68 mod 17 is 0.

You may assume 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000.

### Input

The first line of the input contains the number of test cases, T.

Each test case begins with a line containing three integers, N, K and P. This
is followed by the values of a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ...,
a<sub>N</sub>, one per line.

### Output

Output one line per test case, containing the smallest partial sum modulo P
that is at least K, as described above.

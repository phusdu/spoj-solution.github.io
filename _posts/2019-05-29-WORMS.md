### **Statement**

### Description

A natural number _x_ is called a good number if one or two of the next two
conditions is satisfied:

  * 7 is a divisor of _x_. 
  * 7 is a digit of _x_.

### Task

Write a program that:

  * reads a number _n_ from the standard input, 
  * computes the number of good numbers in range[1,10<sup>n</sup>], 
  * writes the result to the standard output.

Solve the problem by at most 0.5kB of source code.

### Input

The input begins with an integer _t_ ( _t_ <= 210), the number of test cases.
_t_ test cases follow.

For each test case, the first and only line contains an integer _n_ (1 <= _n_
<=500).

### Output

For each test case the output consists of one line that contains the answer.

### Example

    
    
    Sample input:
    3
    1
    2
    1
    
    Sample output:
    1
    30

### **Statement**

Given integer n decide if it is possible to represent it as a sum of two
squares of integers.

### Input

First line of input contains one integer c <= 100 - number of test cases. Then
c lines follow, each of them consisting of exactly one integer 0 <= n <=
10^12.

### Output

For each test case output Yes if it is possible to represent given number as a
sum of two squares and No if it is not possible.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    10
    1
    2
    7
    14
    49
    9
    17
    76
    2888
    27
    
    Output:
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    Yes
    No

### **Statement**

### Description

Hundreds of years ago Johnny's father had a great kingdom. Before his death he
divided his kingdom between his sons (Johnny and Johnny's brother). Johnny's
brother took part of the kingdom with a circular shape with radius _R_.
Jonny took part of kingdom of squared shape with side length _L_. As
Johnny was jealous from his brother after his father's death, he decided to
extend his kingdom to be a circle such that the corners of the square lies
exactly on the border of the circle. A problem might occur that Johnny could
steal some land from his brother, and that could wage a huge war between the
two brothers. So Johnny decided to convince his brother to build a wall
separating between the two kingdoms. The wall should be connecting the two
intersection points between the two circles. You are to estimate the length of
this wall.

### Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer _T_ , the number of test
cases. _T_ test cases follow, the first line of each test case contains 6
floating point numbers; 2 numbers denoting the center of Johnny's brother
kingdom, another 2 for the center of Johnny's kingdom, _R_ the radius of
Johnny's brother kingdom _A_ , and _L_ the side length of the square
of Johnny's kingdom. It’s guaranteed that both kingdoms don’t share any lands
originally. Also after kingdom _B_ is extended, it’s guaranteed that the
intersection area will not cover Johnny's brother kingdom completely. The
absolute value for all decimal numbers will be less than 10<sup>9</sup>.

### Output Format

There should be _T_ lines, containing the following format.

_k. S_

Where _k_ is the test case number (starting at 1), a single period, a
single space and _S_ represent a decimal number with exactly 3 digits
after the decimal point representing the wall length. If there’s no
possibility of war, print “  _No problem_ ”.

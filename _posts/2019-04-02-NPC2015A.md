### **Statement**

Eefun is currently learning to read. His way of learning is unique, by trying
to make every possible substring from a given string. However, when the string
becomes longer, he can no longer remember all the substring. His friends want
to test Eefun's skill by asking questions, given a string S, is there any
substring that begins with letter X and ends with letter Y? According to
Eefun, each substring contains at least 2 letters. As the given string S is
pretty big, Eefun need your help to answer his friend's questions

### Input

First line of input contain a single string S which was given by his friends.  
Second line contain a number N, the number of questions that Eefun's friends
ask.  
Next N lines each consists of 2 characters, X and Y

### Output

For each questions, output a single string "YA" if the substring exists, or
"TIDAK" otherwise  
(YA means yes and TIDAK means no in Indonesian)

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    HALO  
     4  
    H O  
    L O  
    A O  
    O L 
    
    
    Output:
    YA  
     YA  
    YA  
    TIDAK 

### Constraints:

  * 'A' ≤ X,Y ≤ 'Z'
  * 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1.000.000
  * 1 ≤ N ≤ 1.000.000

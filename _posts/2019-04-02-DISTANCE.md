### **Statement**

The L<sub>1</sub> distance of two d-dimensional points is the sum of
absolute values of their coordinate differences (i.e.
Σ<sub>i=1</sub><sup>d</sup> |x<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>i</sub>|
for two points x,y). Given N points in the plane you must find the farthest
pair of points under the L<sub>1</sub> distance metric and output their
distance.

### Input

The first line of the input is "N d" (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ d ≤ 6) signifying
that there are N points in d-dimensional space. N lines then follow, where the
ith line is a space-separated list of d numbers, the coordinates of the ith
point. All given coordinates are integers that are at most 1000000 in absolute
value, and all given points are distinct.

### Output

Your output should consist of a single integer, the farthest distance between
a pair of input points, followed by a newline.

### **Statement**

You are a given a n sided convex polygon. Find total number of intersections
of all diagonals.

Assume that all the intersection points are different.

If in case answer exceeds 10^9 + 7 , take modulo 10^9 + 7

1<=n<=10^8

### Input

First Line : T (no of test cases)

Next T line will contain N no of vertices

### Output

No of intersections of diagonals as specified.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     2  
    4  
    5  
    Â Output:

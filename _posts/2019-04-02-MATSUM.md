### **Statement**

A N Ã— N matrix is filled with numbers. BuggyD is analyzing the matrix, and he
wants the sum of certain submatrices every now and then, so he wants a system
where he can get his results from a query. Also, the matrix is dynamic, and
the value of any cell can be changed with a command in such a system.

Assume that initially, all the cells of the matrix are filled with 0. Design
such a system for BuggyD. Read the input format for further details.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t , the number of test
cases. t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N (1  <= N
<= 1024), denoting the size of the matrix.

A list of commands follows, which will be in one of the following three
formats (quotes are for clarity):

  1. `"SET x y num"` \- Set the value at cell (x, y) to num (0 <= x, y < N ).
  2. `"SUM x1 y1 x2 y2"` \- Find and print the sum of the values in the rectangle from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), inclusive. You may assume that x1 <= x2 and y1 <= y2, and that the result will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
  3. `"END"` \- Indicates the end of the test case.

### Output

For each test case, output one line for the answer to each "SUM" command.
Print a blank line after each test case.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    4
    SET 0 0 1
    SUM 0 0 3 3
    SET 2 2 12
    SUM 2 2 2 2
    SUM 2 2 3 3
    SUM 0 0 2 2
    END
    
    Output:
    1
    12
    12
    13

### **Statement**

N chairs are placed in a circle.

There will be K attendants to a very important meeting.

However, the attendants do not like each other, so they do not want to sit
beside each other in the meeting.

As the host of this important meeting, you want to find out how many ways
there are to choose K chairs such that none of them are adjacent to each
other.

### Input

The first line of the input is an integer N (4<=N<=1000), which denotes the
number of chairs.

The next line is an integer K (1<=K<=N), which denotes the number of
attendants to the meeting.

### Output

Output the total number of ways to choose K chairs from N chairs such that
none of the chairs are adjacent.

Since the answer can get very large, output the answer modulo 1,000,000,003.

### Example

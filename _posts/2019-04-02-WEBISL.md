### **Statement**

For a given set of web pages, we want to find largest subsets such that from
every page in a subset you can follow links to any other page in the same
subset.

### Input

On the first line, there are two numbers, number of the pages N, and total
number of links M. Pages are numbered from 0 up to N-1. On lines 2 up to M+1,
there are two numbers per line. The first is the source page and the second is
the target page of a link.

### Output

On N lines there is a component ID for every single page. The componet ID is
the smallest page index on the component.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3 3  
     0 1  
    1 0  
    1 2  
      
     Output:
    0  
     0  
    2

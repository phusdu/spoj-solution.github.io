### **Statement**

Barney Stinson ;) is way too flirty. He has many girlfriends and he wants to
keep all of them happy. He has M girlfriends. He bought N gifts for
them. Now he knows that some girlfriends need more gifts and some need less.
So he decided that he will give atleast Ai gifts and at most Bi gifts
to his i th girlfriend. He has to give away all the N gifts. Tell us
in how many different ways he can do this.

### INPUT

For each test case, first line contains two integers M and N, then
follows M lines each having two integers Ai and Bi (1  <= i <= M).
Input ends with M and N both equal to 0 and that case should not be processed.

### OUTPUT:

For each test case, output the number of different ways in which he can
distribute those gifts in a single line.

### Constraints

1 <= M <= 20, 1 <= N <= 100, 0 <= Ai, Bi <=100

### Example

Input:

    
    
    3 5
    0 1
    1 3
    1 4
    0 0

Output:

    
    
    6

### Explanation

He can distribute 5 gifts in his 3 girlfriends in 6 different ways as follows
(0 1 4), (0 2 3), (0 3 2), (1 1 3), (1 2 2), (1 3 1).

### **Statement**

Fred Faculty and Paul Power love big numbers. Day after day Fred chooses a
random integer _n_ and he computes _n!_. His friend Paul amuses himself by
computing several powers of his randomly chosen integer _k_ like
_k<sup>2</sup>_ , _k<sup>3</sup>_ and so on. On a hot summer day, Fred
and Paul got really, really bored, so they decided to play a joke on their
buddy Dave Divider. Fred chooses a random integer _n_ while Paul chooses a
random integer _k_. They want Dave to find the biggest integer _i_ such that
_k<sup>i</sup>_ divides _n!_ without a remainder, otherwise they will
throw a cake in Dave's face. Because Dave does not like cakes in his face, he
wants you to help him finding that integer _i_.

### Input

The first line contains the number of test cases _t_ ( _1 ≤ t ≤ 100_ ). Each
of the following _t_ lines contains the two numbers _n,k_ ( _2 ≤ n ≤
10<sup>18</sup>_ , _2 ≤ k ≤ 10<sup>12</sup>_ ) separated by one space.

### Output

For each test case, print the maximum integer _i_ on a separate line.

 *Be careful with overflows in this problem (use 64 bit integers, avoid
multiplications which will lead to overflow).

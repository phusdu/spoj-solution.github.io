title:  MAXSUB - Maximum Subset of Array
categories: ['uncategorized']
code: MAXSUB
src: MAXSUB.py
---

### **Statement**

Given an array find the sum of the maximum non-empty subset of the array and
also give the count of the subset. A subset of an array is a list obtained by
striking off some (possibly none) numbers.

A non-empty subset implies a subset with at least 1 element in it.

### Input

First line contains an integer T which is the number of integers. Following
this T-cases exist.

Each case starts with a line containing an integer n which is the number of
elements in the array.

The next line contains n-integers which contain the value of this subset.

### Constraints

T <= 20

n <= 50,000

Each element in the array <= 1,000,000,000

### Output

For each test case output the value of the maximum subset and the count of the
subsets modulo 1000,000,009

Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    5
    1 -1 1 -1 1
    6
    -200 -100 -100 -400 -232 -450
    
    Output:
    3 1
    -100 2

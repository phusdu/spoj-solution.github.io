### **Statement**

Given a sequence of N pairs of integers, find the length of the longest
increasing subsequence of it.

An increasing sequence _A<sub>1</sub>..A<sub>n</sub>_ is a
sequence such that for every _i < j_, _A<sub>i</sub> < A<sub>j</sub>_.

A subsequence of a sequence is a sequence that appears in the same
relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

A pair of integers _(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)_ is less than
_(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)_ iff _x<sub>1</sub> <
x<sub>2</sub>_ and _y<sub>1</sub> < y<sub>2</sub>_.

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000).

The following N lines consist of N pairs of integers
_(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)_ (-10<sup>9</sup> ≤
_x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>_ ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).

### Output

The output contains an integer: the length of the longest increasing
subsequence of the given sequence.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    8
    1 3
    3 2
    1 1
    4 5
    6 3
    9 9
    8 7
    7 6
    
    Output:
    3

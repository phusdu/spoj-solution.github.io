### **Statement**

[English](/problems/KQUERY2/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/KQUERY2/vn/)  
---|---  
  
Given a sequence of n numbers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ...,
a<sub>n</sub> and a number of k-queries. Besides, you are also given some
modify operations.

A modify operation is a pair (i, v) which means a<sub>i</sub> should be
set to be v.

A k-query is a triple (i, j, k). For each k-query (i, j, k), you have to
return the number of elements greater than k in the subsequence
a<sub>i</sub>, a<sub>i+1</sub>, ..., a<sub>j</sub>.

### Input

  * Line 1: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30000).
  * Line 2: n numbers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub> (1 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>) representing the initial sequence.
  * Line 3: q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200000), the number of operations.
  * In the next q lines, the first number of each line contains a flag value which is either 0 or 1. A flag 0 follows by 2 numbers i and v (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ v ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>) representing a modify operation. A flag 1 follows by 3 numbers i, j and k (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>) representing a k-query. 

### Output

  * For each k-query (i, j, k), print the number of elements greater than k in the subsequence a<sub>i</sub>, a<sub>i+1</sub>, ..., a<sub>j</sub> in a single line.

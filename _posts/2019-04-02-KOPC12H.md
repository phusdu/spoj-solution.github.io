### **Statement**

Rishi loves numbers and number patterns very much. He is interested in finding
OE numbers in a range [a, b]. An OE number is a number whose sum of even
digits [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] is greater than sum of odd digits [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Help
him to count how many OE numbers are in range [a, b] { a and b inclusive }

    
    
    Example: 
      - 4563: O = 5+3   = 8, E = 4+6 = 10, E > O, so 4563 is an OE number
      - 1233, O = 1+3+3 = 7, E = 2,        E < O, so 1233 is not an OE number
      -   10, O = 1,         E = 0         E < O, so 10 is not an OE number

### Input

The first line of the input file contains T which denotes the number of
Test cases. The next T lines contains two space seperated integers a
and b.

1  <= a <= b <=10^8  
T <= 35.

### Output

Print the number of OE numbers in range [ a , b ] {one number per
line}

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    1 1
    2 10
    1 100000000
    
    Output:
    0
    4

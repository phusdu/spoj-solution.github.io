### **Statement**


      
    
    
    Problem Statement:
    
    
    
    
     A number is called strong number if sum of the factorial of its digit is equal to number itself. For example: 145 since
    
    
    
    
    1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
    
    
    
    
    So, 145 isa Strong number. Now givenan positive number N and you have to find the number is strong number or not .
    
    
    
    
    Input:
    
    
    
    
     An integer T (1 <= T <=1000) denoting the number of test cases followed by T lines. Each containing a single integer N (0  <= N <= 10<sup>18</sup>)
    
    
    
    
    Output:
    
    
    
    
     For each case output string “ YES ” if given number is strong number and “ NO ” otherwise.

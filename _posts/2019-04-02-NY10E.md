### **Statement**

A number is said to be made up of non-decreasing digits if all the digits to
the left of any digit is less than or equal to that digit.For example, the
four-digit number 1234 is composed of digits that are non-decreasing. Some
other four-digit numbers that are composed of non-decreasing digits are
0011 , 1111 , 1112 , 1122 , 2223. As it turns out, there
are exactly 715 four-digit numbers composed of non-decreasing digits.  
  
Notice that leading zeroes are required: 0000, 0001, 0002 are all valid four-
digit numbers with non-decreasing digits.  
  
For this problem, you will write a program that determines how many such
numbers there are with a specified number of digits.

### Input

The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ≤ P ≤ 1000), which is
the number of data sets that follow. Each data set is a single line that
contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by a decimal
integer giving the number of digits N, (1 ≤ N ≤ 64).

### Output

For each data set there is one line of output. It contains the data set number
followed by a single space, followed by the number of N digit values that are
composed entirely of non-decreasing digits.

Example

    
    
    Input:  
     3  
    1 2  
    2 3  
    3 4  
      
     Output:  
     1 55  
    2 220  
    3 715

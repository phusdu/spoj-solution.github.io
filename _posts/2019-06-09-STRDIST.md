### **Statement**

Let A = a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>k</sub> and B =
b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub>...b<sub>l</sub> be strings of lengths k
and l, respectively. The string distance between A and B is defined in the
following way (d[i,j] is the distance of substrings
a<sub>1</sub>...a<sub>i</sub> and
b<sub>1</sub>...b<sub>j</sub>, where 0 ≤ i ≤ k and 0 ≤ j ≤ l -- i or j
being 0 represents the empty substring). The definition for d[i, j] is d[0, 0]
= 0 and for (i, j) ≠ (0, 0) d[i, j] is the minimum of all that apply:

  * d[i, j - 1] + 1, if j > 0
  * d[i - 1, j] + 1, if i > 0
  * d[i - 1, j - 1], if i > 0, j > 0, and a<sub>i</sub> = b<sub>j</sub>
  * d[i - 1, j - 1] + 1, if i > 0, j > 0, and a<sub>i</sub> ≠ b<sub>j</sub>
  * d[i - 2, j - 2] + 1, if i ≥ 2, j ≥ 2, a<sub>i</sub> = b<sub>j-1</sub>, and a<sub>i-1</sub> = b<sub>j</sub>

The distance between A and B is equal to d[k,l].

For two given strings A and B, compute their distance knowing that it is not
higher than 100.

### Input

In the first line, k and l are given, giving the lengths of the strings A and
B (1 ≤ k, l ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>). In the second and third lines strings A and
B, respectively, are given. A and B contain only lowercase letters of the
English alphabet.

### Output

In the first line, write one number, the distance between A and B, followed by
a newline.

### **Statement**

Alp and Gaut are like always opposite to each other. Once Alp told that he can
identify a number which is divisible by 252 (He knows because that is his
girlfriends birthday - 25/2). Now to come up against Alp, Gaut said he can
identify whether the number is divisible by 525 (poor Gaut don't have a girl
friend though). The truth is they don't know to do it for big numbers. So you
are here to help them with a method. Given a number you have to tell whether
the number is divisible by 252 and 525.

### Input

Number of testcases in first line, T (T <= 100).

Each line contains one number N, whose divisibility is to be tested (1 <= N <=
10<sup>50000</sup>).

### Output

Each line containing two Yes/No. one for 252 and one for 525.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    4
    252
    525
    16884
    21347
    
    Output:
    Yes No
    No Yes
    Yes No
    No No

### **Statement**

A number is called n -factorful if it has exactly n distinct prime
factors. Given positive integers a , b , and n , your task is to
find the number of integers between a and b , inclusive, that are
n -factorful. We consider 1 to be 0-factorful.

### Input

Your input will consist of a single integer T followed by a newline and
T test cases. Each test cases consists of a single line containing
integers a , b , and n as described above.

T > 10000  
1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10 <sup>6</sup>  
0 ≤ n ≤ 10

### Output

Output for each test case one line containing the number of n -factorful
integers in [ a , b ].

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    5
    1 3 1
    1 10 2
    1 10 3
    1 100 3
    1 1000 0
    
    Output:
    2
    2
    0
    8
    1

### **Statement**

Deepan is a palantir incredible guy who once had a trip in Switzerland. He saw
a weird shop where he liked a teddy. But he din have enough dollars with him
to buy this teddy. But there was a scheme ongoing like solve a equation and
get the teddy && pay whatever we wish.Thats why this shop is weirdo. He had no
eager to buy this teddy as not much of people can solve the equation, so he
was sure he can get this teddy as soon as he solve the problem. He need your
help to solve the equation. You will be given a number N, and you have to tell
whether there exist a number K so that sum of BITS in all the numbers from 1
to K is equal to N. If there exist a K, then print it, else print "`Does Not
Exist.`" without quotes.

### Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^15, 1 <= T <= 10^5.

### Input

First line contains t, number of testcases. For each testcase, first line
contains N.

### Output

Output as described above.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    6
    282657
    377636
    472615
    567594
    662573
    1992279
    
    Output:
    38050
    49299
    Does Not Exist.
    Does Not Exist.

categories: ['uncategorized']
code: GRIDSUM1
src: GRIDSUM1.cpp
---

### **Statement**

This problem is a higher constraints version of
[KWACIK](http://pl.spoj.com/problems/KWACIK/) (Polish).

![Sample case for a=1, b=3 and n=8.](../../../content/min_25:grid_3x3.png)

You are given a 3x3 grid. You can place an integer _m_ (  _a_ ≤ _m_ ≤
_b_ ) in each cell.

How many ways are there to place integers in the cells such that the sum of
each 2x2 subgrid is _n_ ?

### Input

The first line contains an integer _T_ (1 ≤ _T_ ≤ 100), the number of
test cases.

On each of the next _T_  lines, you are given three integers _a_ ,
_b_ and _n_. (0 ≤ _a_ ≤ _b_ ≤ 500, 0 ≤ _n_ ≤ 2000)

### Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to
place integers.

### Example

Input:

    
    
    1
    1 2 5
    

Output:

    
    
    8

### Explanation

There are 8 ways to place integers for _a_ =1, _b_ =2 and _n_ =5.

    
    
    2 1 2 : 2 1 2 : 2 1 1 : 1 2 1 : 1 2 1 : 1 1 2 : 1 1 1 : 1 1 1
    1 1 1 : 1 1 1 : 1 1 2 : 1 1 1 : 1 1 1 : 2 1 1 : 2 1 2 : 1 2 1
    2 1 2 : 1 2 1 : 2 1 1 : 2 1 2 : 1 2 1 : 1 1 2 : 1 1 1 : 1 1 1

### Information

\- There are 7 input files.

\- Changed the time limit of the input file #7 to 20 seconds and rejudged all

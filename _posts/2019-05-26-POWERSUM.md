### **Statement**

The sum of a set is defined as the sum of all elements in the set. You are
given a set of integers, each between 0 and 109. Find the total sum of the
sums of each subset of the set.

### Input

There are several testcases. The first line will contain T, the number of
testcases.

Each of the next T testcases begin with a single integer , n, on the first
line, the number of elements in the set.

The second line of each test case will contain n space separated integers, the
elements of the given set.

Output

For each testcase, you are required to print the total sum of the sums of each
subset of the set. As the answer can be quite large, print it %(109+7).

### Constraints

1<=T<=100.

1<=n<=104

### Example

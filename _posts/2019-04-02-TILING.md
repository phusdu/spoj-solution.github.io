### **Statement**

We say that a 2-dimensional, rectangular word w of size n×m (imagine it as a
board with letter written in the squares) can be tiled with a rectangular
pattern p if there are such occurrences of p in w (but not necessarily all of
them) that no two of them overlap and each symbol (square) of w is covered by
one of them. Given such word w, find a rectangular pattern p of smallest size
(area) which the word w can be tiled with.

### Input

The first line of input contains a number t (1≤t≤100) that indicates the
number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a line consisting
of two positive integers n and m (1≤n,m≤1000) indicating dimensions of the
board. n lines follow, each of them containing m small letters of the English
alphabet (a,b,...,z).

### Output

For each test case output the smallest possible area of a pattern p that can
be used to tile the given board.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3

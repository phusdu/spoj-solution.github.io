### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug lives near an orange tree. Instead of reading books, she
investigates the oranges. The oranges on orange tree can be in up to 5*50
Shades of Orange. She walks from orange to orange, examining different
properties of orange tree. The oranges are connected by branches. There is
more oranges then branches, yet it is still possible to get from any orange to
any other orange [through branches]. The tree is rooted.

Ada has many questions in following form: She goes from orange A to orange
B (by shortest path) and is interested in total number different Shades of
Orange among all subtrees of all edges on shortest path.

### Input

The first line of input consists of 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 , the number of test-
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers 1 ≤ N, Q ≤
4.5*10<sup>5</sup>, 0 ≤ R < N, the number of oranges, the number of
questions and number of root.

Next line contains N integers 1 ≤ S<sub>i</sub> ≤ 250 , the shade
of orange of orange i.

Next N-1 lines contains two integers 0 ≤ I, J < N, I ≠ J , the numbers
of oranges which are connected by branch.

Next Q lines contains two integers 0 ≤ A, B < N, the path Ada is
interested about.

The sum of all N and all Q among all test-cases won't exceed
10<sup>6</sup>

### Output

For each question answer the number of shades in all subtrees of all nodes on
shortest path from A to B.

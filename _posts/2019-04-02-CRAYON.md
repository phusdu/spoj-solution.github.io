no one appreciate her works, so she come up with a puzzle with herself....

### Description

There are only one case in each input file, the first line is a integer N (N
<= 1,000,00) denoted the total operations executed by Mary. Then following N
lines, each line is one of the folling operations.

  * D L R: draw a segment [L, R], 1 <= L <= R <= 1,000,000,000
  * C I: clear the ith added segment. Itâ€™s guaranteed that the every added segment will be cleared only once.
  * Q L R: query the number of segment sharing at least a common point with interval [L, R]. 1 <= L <= R <= 1,000,000,000.

### Input

n

( then following n operations ... )

### Output

(for each query, print the result on a single line ... )

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    6
    D 1 3
    D 2 4
    Q 2 3
    D 2 4
    C 2
    Q 2 3
    
    Output:
    2
    2

### **Statement**

Finding the number of all divisor of a number is too easy. But don’t worry,
this problem is also quite easy.

You will be given the number of all divisor of the factorial of a number, you
will have to find number. If there are multiple such number, you will have to
find the smallest one. If there is no such numbers that meets the constraint
print “nai”.

### Input

The first line of the input will be T, denoting number of test cases. In the
following T lines there will be only one integer N, denoting the number of all
divisor of the factorial of a number X. It is guaranteed that X will be less
than 10^2 + 10.

Constrains:

1 <= t <= 10^5

0 <= n <= 10^18

1 <= X < 10^2 + 10

### Output

For each test case print the number X. If X does not exists or is greater than
10^4 then print "nai" (without the quotes) in a single line. Follow the sample
input/output.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    5
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    
    Output:
    1
    2
    nai
    3
    nai

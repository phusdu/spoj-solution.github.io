### **Statement**

In this problem you have to print all primes from given interval.  

### Input

_t_ \- the number of test cases, then _t_ lines follows. [ _t_ <= 150]  
On each line are written two integers _L_ and _U_ separated by a blank. _L_ \-
lower bound of interval, _U_ \- upper bound of interval. [2  <= _L_ < _U_ <=
2147483647] [ _U-L_ <= 1000000].

### Output

For each test case output must contain all primes from interval _[L; U]_ in
increasing order.  

### Example

Input:

    
    
    2
    2 10
    3 7
    

Output:

    
    
    2
    3
    5
    7
    3
    5
    7

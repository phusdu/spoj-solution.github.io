### **Statement**

You are given an unweighted, undirected graph. Write a program to check if
it's a tree topology.

### Input

The first line of the input file contains two integers _N_ and _M_ \--- number
of nodes and number of edges in the graph (0  < _N_ <= 10000, 0 <= _M_ <=
20000). Next _M_ lines contain _M_ edges of that graph --- Each line contains
a pair ( _u_ , _v_ ) means there is an edge between node _u_ and node _v_ (1
<= _u_ , _v_ <= _N_ ).

### Output

Print _YES_ if the given graph is a tree, otherwise print _NO_.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3 2
    1 2
    2 3
    
    Output:
    YES

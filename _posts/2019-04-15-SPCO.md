### **Statement**

A positive integer is said to be Bit-sum-prime if the sum of all the bits in

its binary representation is a prime number

A positive integer is said to be bitwise prime if the sum of all the bits in
its binary representation is a prime number.

You are given two integers a and b. You have to output number of bitwise prime
numbers between a and b (inclusive).

### Input

First line contains T : number of test cases. (1 <= T <= 10^5)

For next T lines, each test case contains two space seperated integers a and
b. (a <= b). 1 <= a, b <= 10^19.

### Output

For each test case, print the number of bitwise prime numbers between a and b
(inclusive).

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2  
     1 2  
    1 3
    
    Output:
    0  
     1Â

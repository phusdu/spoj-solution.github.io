categories: ['uncategorized']
code: DRUIDEOI
src: DRUIDEOI.cpp

### **Statement**

Druid (AKA Amr Alaa El-Deen) and little EOIers have finished their training
and they are playing "Fatta7y ya warda!". It's a kids game when everyone holds
hands with two other kids forming a circle, and they keep saying "Fatta7y ya
warda!" (Flourish, flower!) (moving away from each other, while still holding
hands, to form a huge circle), then "2affely ya warda!" (Die, flower!) (moving
back as close to each other as possible, while still holding hands, to form a
tiny circle, i.e. a point). That's it!

Anyway the point is...

While Eagle (AKA Mohamed Ahmed) was watching them playing he was wondering,
who's the first person taller than Druid on his left? Similarly, who's the
first person taller than Druid on his right? Help Eagle find the answer for
each person not just Druid.

### Input

The input starts with an integer _T_ (1 ≤ _T_ ≤ 20), the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer
_N_ ( 1 ≤ _N_ ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> ), the number of persons playing the game.
The second line contains _N_ integers _h_ <sub> _i_ </sub> (1 ≤ _h_
<sub> _i_ </sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>) the height of the _i_ -th person.
They are numbered 1 to _N_ starting from Druid.

### Output

For each test case print _N_ lines, in the _i_ -th line print 2 numbers, the
index of the first person taller than the _i_ -th person on his left, and the
index of the first person taller than the _i_ -th person on his right. If no
one is taller than the _i_ -th person print -1 -1.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     3
    5  
    172 170 168 171 169  
    3  
    172 169 172   
     1  
    172
    
    
    Output:
    -1 -1  
     1 4  
    2 4  
    1 1  
    4 1  
    -1 -1  
    1 3  
    -1 -1  
    -1 -1

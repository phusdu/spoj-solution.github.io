### **Statement**

Abotrika is having a party because his team won the African cup so he is
inviting his friends to eat some pizza. Unfortunately, his friends can't eat
an entire pizza but all of them know exactly how much pizza they can eat and
insist on getting the exact amount of pizza but Abotrika eats one complete
pizza and all of them wants his amount of pizza in one slice. Their requests
break down to three different pizza slices-either one quarter or a half or
three quarters of pizza.

Write a program that will help Abotrika to find out what is the minimal number
of pizzas he has to order so that everyone gets exact amount of pizza they
want.

### Input

First line contains an integer _N_ , 0 ≤ N ≤ 10 000, the number of friends. In
each of next _N_ lines there is amount of pizza that each of Abotrika's
friends wants to eat,that is the fraction 1/4, 1/2 or 3/4.

### Output

In the first and only line you should write the minimal number of pizzas
Abotrika has to order don't forget to order one complete pizza for Abotrika.

### **Statement**

The [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) or
rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set
of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to
include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a
given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name
from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack
and must fill it with the most valuable items.

Just implement 0/1 Knapsack.

### Input

First line contains two integers K and N, where K in the maximum knapsack size
and N is the number of items. N lines follow where i<sup>th</sup> line
describes i<sup>th</sup> item in the form v<sub>i</sub> and
w<sub>i</sub> where v<sub>i</sub> is the value and w<sub>i</sub>
is the weight of i<sup>th</sup> item.

### Output

Output a single number - maximum value of knapsack. (All operations and the
answer are guaranteed to fit in signed 32-bit integer.)

Mina and Tina love to play with strings. Mina's favorite string name is A
and Tina's favorite string name is B. One day Tina stole Mina's string.
Now she is wondering the maximum number of string B She can make using
characters from string A. After trying for a long period of time she failed to
figure out the number. Now she is asking for your help to find the number.

<=n,m<=100000). n & m are the size of string A & B
respectively. Second line contains string A and third line contains B.

Input contains only lower case English letter.

characters from string A.

### **Statement**

Given an array of N integers A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>,
A<sub>3</sub>…A<sub>N</sub>. If you randomly choose two indexes i ,j
such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N, what is the expected value of A<sub>i</sub> |
A<sub>j</sub>?

### Input

First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case
consists of two lines. First line denotes the size of array, N and second line
contains N integers forming the array.  
1 ≤ T ≤ 10  
2 ≤ N ≤ 100,000  
0 ≤ Ai < 2<sup>31</sup>

### Output

For each test case, print the answer as an irreducible fraction. Follow the
format of the sample output.  
The fraction p/q (p and q are integers, and both p ≥ 0 and q > 0 holds) is
called irreducible, if there is no such integer d > 1 that divides both p and
q separately.

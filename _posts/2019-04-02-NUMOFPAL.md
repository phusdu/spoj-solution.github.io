title:  NUMOFPAL - Number of Palindromes

code: NUMOFPAL

### **Statement**

Each palindrome can be always created from the other palindromes, if a single
character is also a palindrome. For example, the string "malayalam" can be
created by some ways:

  
* malayalam = m + ala + y + ala + m  
* malayalam = m + a + l + aya + l + a + m  
  
We want to take the value of function NumPal(s) which is the number of
different palindromes that can be created using the string S by the above
method. If the same palindrome occurs more than once then all of them should
be counted separately.  

  

Input

The string S.

  

Output

The value of function NumPal(s).

  

Limitations

0 < |s| <= 1000

  

Example

  

Input:

malayalam

Output:

15

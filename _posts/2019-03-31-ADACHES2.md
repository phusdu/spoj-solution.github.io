### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug was playing [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece)
agains her good friend Velvet Mite Vinit. They came up with new figure, called
palace. In fact, palace is just tower with king inside. It can
attack as king and tower combined: Either anywhere to same column or row
or anywhere to adjacent (by side or diagonal) field.

Their question is simple: How many ways can N palaces be placed on NxN
chessboard so none of them attacks any other. Since this number might be
pretty big, output answer modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7

### Input

The first line of input will contain 1 ≤ T ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> , the
number of test-cases.

Each of the testcases will contain single integer 1 ≤ N ≤
10<sup>7</sup> , the size of chessboard.

### Output

For each test-case output the number of possibilities modulo 1000000007.

### **Statement**

Ada the Ladybug is playing Game of Digits against her friend Velvet Mite
Vinit. The game is played in following manner: At first, there is a four-digit
number and a number of moves. Both Ada and Vinit take turns alternately
(beginning with Ada). Both of them must increase ANY digit of the number, but
if the digit was 9 it will become 0.

For example number 3590 can be expanded to: 4590,3690,3500 or 3591. If after
all turns the number is greater than the original number, Ada wins - otherwise
Vinit is the winner. Both of them play optimaly - can you decide who is the
winner?

PS: It is possible, that Ada will have one more turn (if number of turns is
odd)

### Input

First line of input will consist T ≤ 200 number of test-cases. Each
testcase will consist of four digit number 0 ≤ N < 10<sup>4</sup> [the
original number] and 0 ≤ M ≤ 100 [the number of turns].

### Output

For each test-case, print the name of winner (" Ada " or " Vinit ").

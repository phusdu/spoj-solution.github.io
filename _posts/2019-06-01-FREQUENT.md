categories: ['tree']
code: FREQUENT

### **Statement**

You are given a sequence of n integers a<sub>1</sub> ,
a<sub>2</sub> , ... , a<sub>n</sub> in non-decreasing order. In
addition to that, you are given several queries consisting of indices i
and j ( _1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n_ ). For each query, determine the most frequent
value among the integers a<sub>i</sub> , ... , a<sub>j</sub>.

#### Input Specification

The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line
containing two integers n and q ( _1 ≤ n, q ≤ 100000_ ). The next line
contains n integers a<sub>1</sub> , ... , a<sub>n</sub> (
_-100000 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 100000_ , for each _i ∈ {1, ..., n}_ )
separated by spaces. You can assume that for each _i ∈ {1, ..., n-1}:
a<sub>i</sub> ≤ a<sub>i+1</sub>_. The following q lines contain
one query each, consisting of two integers i and j ( _1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n_
), which indicate the boundary indices for the query.

The last test case is followed by a line containing a single _0_.

#### Output Specification

For each query, print one line with one integer: The number of occurrences of
the most frequent value within the given range.

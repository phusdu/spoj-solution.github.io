title:  MANGOES - Real Mangoes for Ranjith
categories: ['uncategorized']
code: MANGOES

---

### **Statement**

Ranjith is very fond of mangoes. One fine sunny day, he goes to market to get
some mangoes. In the market place, he finds _N_ boxes (indexed from 1 to _N_
), filled with mangoes kept infront of him. Each box indexed _i_ is denoted by
_b<sub>i</sub>_ and contains exactly _i_ mangoes. The number of mangoes in
_b<sub>i</sub>_ is denoted by _m<sub>i</sub>_ and _m_i_ = _i_. Let
_t<sub>i</sub>_ denotes the type of mangoes in box _b<sub>i</sub>_ (
_t<sub>i</sub>_ is either "real" or "fake"). He can choose any box
_b<sub>i</sub>_ ( _i_ <= _N-2_ ), but he doesn't know if the box contains
"real" mangoes or "fake" mangoes i.e. type of box _b<sub>i</sub>_.

The type of mangoes in _b<sub>i</sub>_ depends on the number of mangoes in
boxes _b<sub>i</sub>_ , _b<sub>i+1</sub>_ , _b<sub>i+2</sub>_ i.e.
{ _m<sub>i</sub>_ , _m<sub>i+1</sub>_ , _m<sub>i+2</sub>_ }.
Mangoes in box _b<sub>i</sub>_ are "real" if for each pair of numbers
taken from set { _m<sub>i</sub>_ , _m<sub>i+1</sub>_ ,
_m<sub>i+2</sub>_ }, Greatest common divisor(GCD) equals 1. Otherwise,
"fake". Note that _t<sub>i</sub>_ is not defined for _i_ = _N-1_ and _i_ =
_N_ and assumed to be "fake".

Given _N_ , Ranjith wants to know the total number of "real" mangoes he will
get from all boxes. As Ranjith cannot count beyond _N_ , output the result
modulo _N_.

### Input

Test File starts with number of test cases - _T_ ;

_T_ lines follows, each containing _N_ , number of boxes.

### Output

Output _T_ lines Number of "real" mangoes Ranjith gets (modulo _N_ ) in each
one of the _T_ cases.

### Constraints

2  < _N_ <= 10^8  
_T_ <= 10000

### **Statement**

As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. Beside of growing
vegetable she also breeds greenflies. There are many kinds of greenflies and
it is not trivial to breed them since they behave very strangely. Each kind of
greenfly is known under a number. As you have multiple greenflies in a single
coop, they produce as much juice as the greatest common divisor of their
numbers.

Ada owns a row of greenflies (of several kinds) and she can split them by a
fence, so that always a continuous segment of greenflies will be in a same
coop

Ada wants to find out the sum of procution of greenflies over all possible
continuous segments (of size at least one), can you help her?

### Input

The first line contains an integer 1 ≤ N ≤ 3*10<sup>5</sup> , the
number of greenflies in row.

The second line contains N integers 0 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤
10<sup>6</sup>

### Output

Print a single line: the sum of production of all continuous segments.

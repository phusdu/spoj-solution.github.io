### **Statement**

[English](/problems/TWINSNOW/en/) | [Tiếng Việt](/problems/TWINSNOW/vn/)  
---|---  
  
You may have heard that no two snowflakes are alike. Your task is to write a
program to determine whether this is really true. Your program will read
information about a collection of snowflakes, and search for a pair that may
be identical. Each snowflake has six arms. For each snowflake, your program
will be provided with a measurement of the length of each of the six arms. Any
pair of snowflakes which have the same lengths of corresponding arms should be
agged by your program as possibly identical.

### Input

\- The first line of input will contain a single integer n; the number of
snowflakes to follow.  
\- This will be followed by n lines, each describing a snowflake. Each
snowflake will be described by a line containing six integers (each integer is
at least 0 and less than 10000000), the lengths of the arms of the snowflake.
The lengths of the arms will be given in order around the snowflake (either
clockwise or counterclockwise), but they may begin with any of the six arms.
For example, the same snowflake could be described as 1 2 3 4 5 6 or 4 3 2 1 6
5.

### Output

If all of the snowflakes are distinct, your program should print the message:

    
    
    No two snowflakes are alike.

If there is a pair of possibly identical snowflakes, your program should print
the message:

    
    
    Twin snowflakes found.

### **Statement**

Rama Rao is the topper of his branch. One of his friends was jealous of it.
So, he poses a question to test Rama Rao and is as follows:

For a given n , find the number of even and odd numbers among the set,
{ <sup>n</sup> C <sub>0</sub> ,
<sup>n</sup>C<sub>1</sub>,... <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n
</sub>}.

Rama Rao was having hard time solving it. He hopes you can help him.

### Input

First line contains t( 1 <=t<=10<sup>5</sup>), the number of test
cases. Next t lines contain one integer per line, denoting n(0
<=n<=10<sup>12</sup>).

### Output

For each test case, output two space separated integers specifying the number
of even numbers and odd numbers respectively.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    
    
    3
    
    
    4
    
    Output:
    0 4
    
    
    3 2
    
    
    Explaination:
    
    
     for 3, values are: 1 3 3 1. All are odd. Hence 0 4
    
    
     for 4, values are: 1 4 6 4 1. Hence 3 2

### **Statement**

A knight is located at the (black) origin of an infinite chessboard. Let
_f(n)_ define the number of black squares the knight can reach after making
exactly _n_ moves. Given _n_ (0 <= _n_ <= 10<sup>8</sup>), output _f(n)_.

### Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test
cases (1 <= T <= 10<sup>6</sup>). Each test case consists of a single
positive integer _n_.

### Output

For each value of _n_ in the input, print a single line containing.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     2  
    0  
    1  
      
     Output:  
     1  
    0

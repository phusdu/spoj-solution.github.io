### **Statement**

Given a graph, you have to find if the graph can be drawn without taking the
hands away. Assume that you are going to draw the given graph on a paper and
you have to find whether you can draw it at a single stroke, i.e, without
taking the hands away. And also, you are allowed to draw the graph only once.
That is, you can't draw a single edge more than once. The given graph will
have N nodes, numbered from 1 to N.

Consider the following graphs. For input clarity of the graphs, refer to the
sample input

![Graph 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5smf3qpepzn3juw/pic1.png?dl=0)

![Graph 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ys2gmdmatq83l4s/Shp6.jpg?dl=0)

### Input

The first line has the number of test cases, T.

Then for each test case, the first line has the integer N, the number of
nodes.

The second line has the integer K.

Then K lines follow that, each line having three integers S, D, M denoting
that there are M edges between the two nodes S and D.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 50

1 <= N <= 100

1 <= K <= (N * ( N – 1) ) / 2

1 <= S, D <= N

1 <= M <= 100

### Output

For each test case, if the graph can be drawn so, print "YES" followed by a
single space and the node from which you have to start drawing. If there are
more than one node from where it's right to start drawing, print the node with
the least value.

If the graph can't be drawn so, just print "NO".

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
    
     2
    
    4
    
    6
    
    1 2 2
    
    1 3 1
    
    1 4 2
    
    2 3 2
    
    2 4 1
    
    3 4 2
    
    5
    
    10
    
    1 2 1
    
    1 3 1
    
    1 4 1
    
    1 5 1
    
    2 3 1 
    
    2 4 1
    
    2 5 1
    
    3 4 1
    
    3 5 1
    
    4 5 1

Output:

    
    
     NO
    YES 1
    
    
    Note:
    
    
    
    
     1) If there are more than one edge between two nodes, assume that those edges are of different forms. See the above picture for more clarity.
    
    2) If there are M edges from S to D, then there are also M edges from D to S.
    
    3) If you can't view the images, go to

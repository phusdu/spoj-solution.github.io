### **Statement**

Little Feluda likes to play very much. As you know he only plays with numbers.
So he is given n numbers. Now tries to group the numbers into disjoint
collections each containing two numbers. He can form the collection containing
two numbers iff small number in the collection is exactly half of large
number.

Given n numbers, Find out how many maximum number of collections he can form ?

### Input

T: number of test cases. (1 <= T <= 100).

For each test case:

First line will contain n : (1 <= n <= 100)

Then next line will contain n numbers single space seperated. Range of each
number will be between 1 and 10^6.

### Output

For each test case, output maximum number of collections that can be formed.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2  
     2  
    1 2  
    3   
    1 2 4  
     Output:  
     1  
    1

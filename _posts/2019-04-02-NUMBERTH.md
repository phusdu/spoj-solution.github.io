for all the IUTians recently where you met many peoples. As you are an
introvert, Your seniors have given you a simple task so that you can become
more social. The task is You'll have meet n people and ask their roll and then
you'll have to talk with him minimum of m minutes. Here m is the beauty value
of his roll.

Beauty value of a roll is the number of different prime numbers that can be
generated by taking some digits from the roll and suffling them. For example
if the roll is 17, the beauty value is 3, because the only primes can be
generated from this are 7,17,71.

### **Statement**

Everyday morning Nabil and Muzahid go to the famous hotel “Ruchi Bilash” and

complete their breakfast. But they have a system in it, everyday don’t know
how, always Nabil makes a

bigger bill. For example: – Nabil made 65 tk and Muzahid made 55 tk. But there
is a Funny thing.

Muzahid always gives the waiter tips at least 1 taka. And for that tips, they
both pay equal. If we

consider previous example, than Nabil will pay 65 and Muzahid will also pay
65, His bill is 55 and 10 tk

tip for waiter. Remember: Muzahid’s bill never crosses Nabil’s bill.

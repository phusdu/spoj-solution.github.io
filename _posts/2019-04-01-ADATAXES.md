### **Statement**

As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She grows vegetables
in a long furrow. All of the vegetables have some height. Local politicians
tax small vegetables, but as the furrow is very long, they always tax just a
part of it.

The taxes always have some limit on height. They are calculated very simply:
Tax collectors multiply the heights of all vegetables, which are lesser or
equal to limit and are on desired segment.

The taxes might be very high so tax collectors just round their income and
take only 1000000007 ( 10<sup>9</sup>+7 ) banknotes. They are very
kind, so they always leave the rest to Ada. She is interested in how much they
will leave her.

NOTE: If none of the vegeteble is lesser/equal to given limit, Ada is left
with symbolical 1 "money".

### Input

The first line contains an integer 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 3*10<sup>5</sup> , the
number of vegetables Ada grows and the number of times the tax collectors
come.

The second line contains N integers 1 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤
3*10<sup>5</sup> , the heights of vegetables.

The next Q lines contains three integers 0 ≤ L ≤ R < N, the left and
right vegetables of segment and 1≤ H ≤ 3*10<sup>5</sup> , the limit.

### Output

Print a single line for each query with the number of money Ada will be left
with after each tax collecting.

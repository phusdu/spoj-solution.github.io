### **Statement**

Ananta Jalil is a multi talented person. He can make any task possible which
is impossible to others. Recently he has learned programming basic. In a
problem, he submitted the following solution:

    
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main()
    {
        int t;
        scanf("%d", &t);
        for(int tc = 1; tc <= t; ++tc) {
            int a, b, c;
            scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
            long long result = 0;
            for(int i = 1; i <= a; ++i) {
                for(int j = 1; j <= b; ++j) {
                    for(int k = 1; k <= c; ++k) {
                        result += j * k;
                    }
                }
            }
            printf("Case %d: %lld
", tc, result);
        }
        return 0;
    }
    

But he got TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) as he is novice in programming. Thatâ€™s
why his solution was not efficient. So you are here to write an optimized
solution for Jalil which will give the same output.

### Input

The first line of input will contain a positive integer T denoting the number
of test cases.

In each test case, there will be 3 positive integers a, b and c.

### Constraints

  * T <= 1000
  * a <= 30
  * b <= 100000
  * c <= 10000

### Output

For each test case, print the output as same as the above program.

### Example

#### Input

    
    
    3
    1 4 3
    3 4 2
    143 342 777

#### Output

    
    
    Case 1: 60
    Case 2: 90
    Case 3: 2535110464887

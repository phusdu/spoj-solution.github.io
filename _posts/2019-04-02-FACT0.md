title:  FACT0 - Integer Factorization (15 digits)
categories: ['number-theory']
code: FACT0
src: FACT0.cpp
---

### **Statement**

This is a problem to test the robustness of your Integer Factorization
algorithm.

Given some integers, you need to factor them into product of prime numbers.

The largest integer given in the input file has 15 digits.
[FACT1](/problems/FACT1) is a harder version of this problem (the numbers are
larger).

You may need to use a general factorization algorithm since no special numbers
(e.g. Fermat numbers) are considered when designing the input data.

### Input

There are several numbers given, each one in a line.

The input ends with a number 0.

The number of test cases is about 10.

### Output

For each number, print in a line the factorization of it. See examples below
for the output format.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3111989
    13091989
    77145199750673
    0
    
    Output:
    317^1 9817^1
    17^2 89^1 509^1
    328439^1 234884407^1

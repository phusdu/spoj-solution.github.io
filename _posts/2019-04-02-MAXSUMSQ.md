### **Statement**

Given an array A having n elements, let X be the maximum sum of any contiguous
sequence in the array. How many contiguous sequences in A sum up to X ?

### Input

The first line contains T the number of test cases. There follow 2T lines, 2
for each test case. The first line contains the n, the number of elements in
the array. The second line contains n space seperated integers Ai.

### Output

Output T lines, one for each test case. On each line, output two space
seperated integers; the maximum sequence sum, and the number of sequences
which obtain this maximum sum.

### Example

Sample Input

    
    
    2  
     3  
    -1 -1 -1  
    4  
    2 0 -2 2

Sample Output

    
    
    -1 3  
     2 4

### Constraints

  
1 <= T <= 35  
1 <= n <= 100000  
-1000 <= Ai <= 1000

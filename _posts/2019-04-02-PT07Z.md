title:  PT07Z - Longest path in a tree
categories: ['dfs']
code: PT07Z
src: PT07Z.cpp
---

### **Statement**

You are given an unweighted, undirected tree. Write a program to output the
length of the longest path (from one node to another) in that tree. The length
of a path in this case is number of edges we traverse from source to
destination.

### Input

The first line of the input file contains one integer _N_ \--- number of nodes
in the tree (0  < _N_ <= 10000). Next _N_ -1 lines contain _N_ -1 edges of
that tree --- Each line contains a pair ( _u_ , _v_ ) means there is an edge
between node _u_ and node _v_ (1  <= _u_ , _v_ <= _N_ ).

### Output

Print the length of the longest path on one line.

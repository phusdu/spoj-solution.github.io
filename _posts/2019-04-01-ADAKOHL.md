code: ADAKOHL

### **Statement**

As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She has a garden with
kohlrabi. Each kohlrabi has assigned a quality, which is a number (possibly
negative, since the kohlrabi might be rotten).

Ada wants to gather some kohlrabi so she wants to pick a line such that the
sum of kohlrabi on the line is maximal. Can you help her to find such line?

### Input

The first line of input containts 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 , the number of test-cases
(anyway note that for biggest test-cases there will be only 1 test-case).

The first line of each test-case contains 0 < N ≤ 3000 , the number of
kohlrabi.

The next N lines contains three integers x, y, q: -10<sup>9</sup> ≤
x, y ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>, -10<sup>4</sup> ≤ q ≤ 10<sup>4</sup> ,
the coordinates of kohlrabi and its quality (note that no two kohlrabil will
grow on same coordinates).

### Output

For each test-case, print the best achieavable sum of qualities of kohlrabies
on a single line.

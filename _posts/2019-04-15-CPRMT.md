### **Statement**

Given two strings of lowercase letters, _a_ and _b_ , print the
longest string _x_ of lowercase letters such that there is a permutation
of _x_ that is a subsequence of _a_ and there is a permutation of
_x_ that is a subsequence of _b_.

### Input

Input file contains several lines of input. Consecutive two lines make a set
of input. That means in the input file line 1 and 2 is a set of input,
line 3 and 4 is a set of input and so on. The first line of a pair
contains _a_ and the second contains _b_. Each string is on a separate
line and consists of at most 1000 lowercase letters.

### Output

For each set of input, output a line containing _x_. If several _x_
satisfy the criteria above, choose the first one in alphabetical order.

### Example

    
    
    Sample input:
    pretty
    women
    walking
    down
    the
    street
     
    Sample output:
    e

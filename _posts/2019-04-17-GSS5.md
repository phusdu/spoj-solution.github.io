### **Statement**

You are given a sequence A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] . ( |A[i]| <= 10000 , 1 <= N <=
10000 ). A query is defined as follows: Query(x1,y1,x2,y2) = Max {
A[i]+A[i+1]+...+A[j] ; x1 <= i <= y1 , x2 <= j <= y2 and x1 <= x2 , y1 <= y2
}. Given M queries (1 <= M <= 10000), your program must output the results of
these queries.

### Input

The first line of the input consist of the number of tests cases <= 5. Each
case consist of the integer N and the sequence A. Then the integer M. M lines
follow, contains 4 numbers x1, y1, x2 y2.

### Output

Your program should output the results of the M queries for each test case,
one query per line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    2
    6 3 -2 1 -4 5 2
    2
    1 1 2 3
    1 3 2 5
    1 1
    1
    1 1 1 1
    
    Output:
    2
    3
    1

title:  FACTMULN - Product of factorials (easy)
categories: ['uncategorized']
code: FACTMULN
src: FACTMULN.cpp

### **Statement**

For n positive integer, let _F(n) = 1! × 2! × 3! × 4! × ... × n!_ ,
product of factorial(i) for i in [1..n]. Let _G(n) = {i in [1..n], such that
n divides F(i)}_. It is obvious that _n_ belongs to _G(n)_ that
makes it a non empty set.

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer _T_ , the number of test
cases. On each of the next _T_ lines, your are given an integer _n_.

### Output

For each test case, you have to print _min(G(n))_.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    4
    5
    6
    
    
    
    Output:
    3
    5
    3
    

### Explanation

For test case #1: F(1) = 1! = 1 , not divisible by 4 F(2) = 1! × 2! = 2 , not
divisible by 4 F( 3 ) = 1! × 2! × 3! = 12 , divisible by 4 F(4) = 1! ×
2! × 3! × 4! = 288 , divisible by 4 So G(4) = { 3 , 4}.

### Constraints

    
    
    0 < T < 10^4
    0 < n < 10^9
    

A little kB of Python code can get AC in half the time limit. (Edit
2017-02-11, after the compiler changes.) Input is not randomly chosen ;-) Have
fun.

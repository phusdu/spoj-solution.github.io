### **Statement**

### Warning

Here is a harder version of [ Amazing Factor Sequence
](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AFS/).

To make things clear, you'll need a O(n^0.5) method to solve this problem.
You'll need to be careful with container of C-like language, and/or you'll
need to find some little optimizations with slower language.

### The factor sequence

We define our factor sequence with:

_a[0] = a[1] = 0_ , and

for _n > 1, a[n] = a[n - 1] + sum({x | x < n and n % x = 0})_.

### Input

First line of input contains an integer _T_ , the number of test cases.

Each of the next _T_ lines contains a single integer _n_.

### Output

For each test case, print _a[n]_ on a single line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    3
    4
    5
    
    
    Output:
    2
    5
    6

### Constraints

    
    
    0 < T < 101
    0 < n < 12148001999
    

Numbers _n_ are uniform-randomly chosen. _Nmax_ was carefully chosen
;-) Time limit is Ã—2.5 my python one (2.56s). (Edited 2017-02-11, after
compiler changes)
